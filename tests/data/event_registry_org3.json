    "body": "Derby County player Max Lowe has said he is \"shocked\" by comments from pundit Craig Ramage on BBC Radio Derby that suggested \"young black lads\" should \"go back to basics, working hard\".\n\nEx-Rams midfielder Ramage was speaking on the Sportscene Podcast after their 1-1 draw with Huddersfield Town.\n\nLowe, 22, posted on social media calling out \"racial ignorance, stereotyping and intolerance\".\n\nThe BBC said the comments were \"entirely unacceptable\".\n\nFormer England Under-21 international Lowe said he had decided to \"speak out on behalf of black players at Derby County\", including fellow full-back Jayden Bogle, 19, whose recent performances, along with Lowe's, came in for criticism by Ramage.\n\nDuring the broadcast, Ramage, who the BBC confirmed would no longer work with the corporation, said: \"When I look at certain players, their body language, their stance, the way they act, you just feel, hold on a minute, he needs pulling down a peg or two.\n\n\"So I'd probably say that about all the young black lads, all the young advice if they wanted it, that, you know, it's about, when you are struggling for form, you are going through a sticky patch, it's about going back to basics, working hard, and doing the right things.\"\n\nFollowing the podcast's publication, Lowe posted a statement on Instagram that said: \"As a young black footballer making my way in the game, I was shocked by comments made by one of the analysts on BBC Radio Derby's Sportscene programme after our 1-1 draw with Huddersfield.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Racial ignorance, stereotyping and intolerance negatively affects the image of impressionable young footballers and creates an unnecessary divide in society.\n\n\"I am also disappointed that a public service broadcaster did not step in to ask the analyst to explain his reasoning or to distance themselves from these archaic thoughts.\n\n\"This was a broadcast at the same time BBC Derby is promoting a 27-minute feature with former Rams defender Charlie Palmer about the difficulties he faced as a young black footballer in the 1980s.\"\n\nHe added that \"as a professional footballer at an ambitious, high-profile Championship club I know that my performances will be scrutinised and I have no problem with that whatsoever - but I do not think it is acceptable for myself and my team-mate Jayden Bogle to be judged by the colour of our skin\".\n\nDerby County FC said it was \"aware of comments made by a BBC employee after yesterday's game against Huddersfield Town, directed specifically at a section of our young players\".\n\nThe club added: \"We have been in contact with the BBC throughout the day and underline that we do not in any way condone any form of discrimination.\n\n\"We take comments like these extremely seriously, we do not tolerate them, and stand shoulder to shoulder, together as one with all our players.\"\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"These were entirely unacceptable comments and we will no longer be working with Craig.\"",

He didn't mean it. That is new to me.\n\n\"I don't like talking about officials especially after a defeat because you can look like the violin is out or you are looking for excuses but when I think the timing is right, I must say I was disappointed in them today.\n\n\"People will probably look at highlights and think Rangers rode their luck because they hit the post but if we had good and the right officials today, that would have been a 3-0 win, if we score the penalty.\n\n\"I am not sure you would back us to do that right now but we could have been out of sight and a lot more comfortable if the officiating had been better.\n\n\"It is nothing to do with how I feel or where we are. I just think at this level you expect decisions like that to be right and that is all I ask.\"\n\nMidfielder Halliday was injured in the 66th minute after falling over an advertising board and hitting a chair.\n\nAnd Gerrard praised the 28-year-old for continuing, despite receiving stitches.\n\n\"He's gone over the advertising boards and nearly lost his eye, because the chair has gone into just above the eye,\" said the Rangers manager.\n\n\"He's had stitches and carried on so I'm really pleased with his bravery and character to carry on.\"",

    "body": "Even by the standards of his remarkable year, it has been quite a few days for Glamorgan's Australia batsman Marnus Labuschagne.\n\nFirst he was compared to legend Sachin Tendulkar by the Indian batsman himself before being named the Australian Test player of the year ahead of Steve Smith.\n\nLabuschagne was a concussion substitute for Smith during the second Ashes Test in Lord's in August 2019 where he scored 59 to help salvage a draw.\n\nHe was named in the ICC's 2019 Test Team of the Year after scoring the most runs in the calendar year with 1,104 in 17 innings at an average of just under 65.\n\nThis included three centuries against Pakistan and New Zealand before an international best of 215 against the Black Caps in Sydney in January 2020.\n\n\"I am lucky to have so many great players in the Australia team to learn off and when you look at people like Steve Smith, someone like that has set the bar so high,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"This award was pretty amazing to receive. As a team we had a great year and to finish the summer as the Australia Test player of the year was special and I am very honoured.\n\n\"The way the team has played over the last six months has been terrific, retaining the Ashes and then beating New Zealand and Pakistan in five Tests at home.\n\n\"You look at the likes of David Warner, Steve, our fast bowlers and Nathan Lyon who have all been tremendous with the pressure we can apply daily.\n\n\"It's a privilege to play with these guys and I will continue to learn as much as I can.\"\n\nLabuschagne was also given special praise by India legend Tendulkar, who holds the Test record of 15,921 runs in 200 matches.\n\nTendulkar said he knew Labuschagne was special within 15 minutes of watching him and likened the Australian to his own style.\n\n\"I was honoured hearing those words from Sachin,\" said Labuschagne.\n\n\"It was amazing to hear somebody of that calibre say something like that about me. It is making sure you take that on board but also stay grounded.\n\n\"Cricket is a fickle game. At the moment things are looking good and it's about keeping that feeling.\"\n\nAfter making his mark in Test cricket, Labuschagne scored 100 runs in his first two one-day international innings and hopes to become a regular across all three formats for Australia.\n\nHe also says he is indebted to Glamorgan's role in his rise after joining them in 2019.\n\nThe 25-year-old scored 1,114 county championship runs in 10 matches before winning back his international place against England at Lord's.\n\n\"Glamorgan have played a massive part in my last 12 months,\" said Labuschagne.\n\n\"The way (coach) Matt Maynard spoke about the game resonates with me and I love talking to him about cricket. I learned so much in my time there and put a lot of things into practice.\n\n\"Scoring runs was always something I wanted to do for Glamorgan and they gave me the opportunity to do that.\n\n\"Then came the chance to play in the Ashes and it has all developed from there.\"\n\nLabuschagne has signed for Glamorgan for two more seasons but his presence will be limited after the opening two months of the British summer because of his international success and desire to play all three formats.\n\nAustralia have a two Test tour of Bangladesh in June, one-day and T20 internationals in England between July 3 and 16, and three one-day internationals at home to Zimbabwe in August,\n\n\"I can't say the exact amount because it is all depending on selections,\" said Labuschagne.\n\n\"I know I am available for the first six championship games or the opening two months and then Australia have a tour to Bangladesh.\n\n\"There are some one-dayers directly after the Bangladesh tour in England before a bit more of a break where I will be able to play a few more games with Glamorgan. Then we will have to wait and see to see how the rest of it pans out.\n\n\"I just have to make sure when I am there I am enjoying it with the playing and coaching staff. I love playing in Wales and it's why I have signed for the next two seasons.\n\n\"It will be nice to get back to Glamorgan this season and a change in conditions. I can rug up with my jumpers and have hand warmers in my pockets.\n\n\"I just want to keep playing as many games as I can and that's the way to keep on top of my game and have some momentum. There will be times you have to have rest at some points but I just love playing.\"",

    "body": "In 2011, Scott Young took on a challenge that perplexed many of his peers. He would attempt to complete an MIT computer science degree without enrolling in the elite Boston-based university, using free materials that MIT posted online. Young built a curriculum using recorded classes, did the necessary assignments and exams mirroring the constraints and conditions (to the extent possible) that MIT students were subject to. He graded everything himself, using the solutions and marking schedule that MIT made available. In the end, he 'completed' the equivalent of what an MIT degree might look like without paying any tuition fees. His only expenses were the required textbooks.\n\nYoung already held a bachelor's degree in business, as he explained in his 2012 TEDx Talk. But several years into his career, he knew he wanted to study computer science. Yet he didn't want to commit to a four-year degree; if a degree was like eating a five-course meal, he wanted his education 'a la carte'.\n\nYoung's approach to education might be an anomaly, and it's important to note that he undertook the project out of curiosity rather than as a training mechanism for a programming career; he did not obtain an 'official' MIT degree. Yet as the cost of a university education continues to balloon, many wonder whether the return on the investment is worth it and if there might be alternative paths to job success.",

    "body": "Porto forward Moussa Marega walked off mid-way through his side's win at Vitoria Guimaraes, saying he was subjected to racist abuse from fans.\n\nMarega, 28, started to walk towards the dugouts in the 69th minute, nine minutes after scoring what would prove the winner in Porto's 2-1 victory.\n\nHe pointed his thumbs down and also raised his middle fingers to the crowd.\n\nTeam-mates and opposition players tried to persuade him to stay on, but he was eventually substituted.\n\n\"We are a family regardless of nationality, skin colour, hair colour,\" said Porto boss Sergio Conceicao. \"We are human, we deserve respect. What happened here is unfortunate.\n\n\"We are completely indignant about what happened. I know the passion that exists for Vitoria and I think most of the fans do not see themselves in the same attitude of some people who have insulted Moussa since the warm-up.\"\n\nFC Porto's match report on their website described it as \"a sad situation that should make the Guimaraes club and Portuguese football blush with shame\".\n\nTeam-mates including Alex Telles, Sergio Oliveira and Ivan Marcano all tried to stop Marega walking off the pitch, grabbing the Malian player around the waist - but he pushed everyone aside on his way to the tunnel.\n\nMarega spent a season on loan at Vitoria in the 2016-17 campaign, scoring 15 goals in 25 games.",

    "body": "A French ski resort has used helicopters to deliver snow after mild weather dried out its slopes, threatening it with closure.\n\nThe Luchon-Superbagn\u00e8res resort in the Pyrenees arranged for around 50 tonnes of snow to be dropped on its slopes.\n\nTaken from higher mountains, the snow was dumped on slopes for beginners and children on Friday and Saturday.\n\nTemperatures have risen above 10C across the Pyrenees this week, leaving ski slopes devoid of snow.\n\nMilder weather and a lack of snow during winter are trends that meteorologists have linked to climate change.\n\nIn order to keep Luchon-Superbagn\u00e8res open, the local council arranged for snow to be sent at a cost of more than 5,000 euros (\u00a34,150).\n\nHerv\u00e9 Pounau, director of the local council, said it was a worthwhile investment.\n\n\"We're not going to cover the entire ski station in snow, but without it we would have had to close a huge part of the ski domain, and it's during the holidays that we have the most activity for beginners and the ski schools,\" Mr Pounau said.\n\nThe school holidays in February and March are typically the busiest time of year for ski resorts in France.\n\nThe jobs of up to 80 people, including lift operators, ski school teachers and child minders, will be protected by keeping the resort open, Mr Pounau said.\n\nHowever, the delivery of snow has been criticised by environmental groups.\n\n\"Instead of adapting to global warming we're going to end up with a double problem: something that costs a lot of energy, that contributes heavily to global warming and that in addition is only for an elite group of people who can afford it. It is the world upside down,\" Bastien Ho, of green group Europe \u00c9cologie Les Verts (EELV), told French television.\n\nMr Pounau conceded that moving the snow was not a \"particularly ecological\" solution but said \"we had no choice\".\n\nMany other ski resorts in the Pyrenees mountains are facing an uncertain future, as low snowfall levels result in fewer visitors.\n\nThis month, the ski resort of Le Mourtis was forced to temporarily close down its ski runs in mid-season, impacting the local economy.\n\nUnseasonably mild temperatures have melted snow at lower altitude ski resorts. France experienced its mildest January since 1900, according to Meteo-France, the country's national forecaster.",

    "body": "Former Wales fly-half Nicky Robinson believes Wayne Pivac might only try to recall Rhys Priestland if he does not think Sam Davies is part of his plans.\n\nPriestland, 33, is currently ineligible for national selection because he plays outside Wales with Bath.\n\nWales have Six Nations fly-half injury worries with Dan Biggar a concern to face France on 22 February.\n\n\"Sam could come in and has played international rugby,\" said Robinson.\n\nWith 50 internationals to his name, Priestland falls below the current 60-cap rule which stops people playing club rugby outside of Wales being selected for Test rugby.\n\nPivac would have to ask the Professional Rugby Board (PRB), made up of regional and WRU representatives, to give him permission to select Priestland, who last played for Wales against New Zealand in November 2017.\n\nDragons fly-half Davies would be the obvious Wales-based option to be called up after being involved in Pivac's first squad for the uncapped victory over Barbarians in November 2019.\n\nGareth Anscombe, Owen Williams and Rhys Patchell are sidelined through injury leaving Biggar and Jarrod Evans as the only two fly-halves in the squad.\n\nBiggar is an injury concern ahead of the France match in Cardiff after failing a head injury assessment in the second-half defeat against Ireland.\n\nIt was a third head injury in five months for Biggar following knocks in the World Cup in Japan which forced him off the field against Australia and Fiji.\n\nAssistant coach Neil Jenkins last week said Wales were confident the first-choice fly-half would be fit to face France but the squad still lacks cover.\n\nPriestland would provide more experience than Davies, 26, and Evans, 23, who have 13 caps between them, while uncapped Bristol fly-half Callum Sheedy is another option.\n\n\"Sam is in Wales and no rules would have to be bent or changed for him to come in,\" said Robinson.\n\n\"If the coaches don't see him as part of their plans moving forward then someone like Rhys could still play a part in international rugby because he is not at the end of his career by any stretch.\n\n\"If they want to bring him back in and feel he is good enough there are ways around it to make sure we have a full quota of players.\n\n\"But if he needs to come in straight away on Monday to get used to the system, fly-half is a difficult position to come into, when you haven't been with the squad at all.\"\n\nPriestland joined Bath from Scarlets in 2015 and signed a new two-year deal with the English club in April 2019 that rendered him ineligible.\n\n\"It was a bit strange how he was under pressure from supporters when he was in Wales,\" added Robinson.\n\n\"For some reasons some players have found it difficult such as him and Alex Cuthbert who have decided to leave the goldfish bowl of Wales and go play rugby in England.\n\n\"He has been successful in Bath, enjoyed himself there and his game has developed.\"",

    "body": "Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho says Manchester City deserve the \"benefit of the doubt\" over their two-season ban from European club competition until their appeal is heard.\n\nCity were also fined 30m euros (\u00a325m) on Friday for \"serious breaches\" of Uefa's financial regulations.\n\nCity say they will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\n\"At the end of the process we will see if they are punished or not,\" Mourinho said.\n\n\"Uefa punished them but they have the chance to appeal. Until the appeal finishes I think Manchester City has the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nMourinho's Spurs side climbed up to fifth in the Premier League with a last-minute 3-2 win at Aston Villa on Sunday.\n\nIt is not clear whether the team that finishes fifth this season will get a Champions League place if Manchester City's ban is upheld for 2021/22.\n\n\"When we speak about fifth, Wolves, Sheffield [United], Manchester United, Arsenal and Everton look to the table and week after week say, 'We can do it' and they can,\" Mourinho added.\n\n\"So it is going to be very hard. We have a big fight and you could see on Saturday, Liverpool was first versus last, and today with Villa fighting to stay in the division how difficult it was.\"\n\nMikel Arteta, who was City boss Pep Guardiola's assistant at the Etihad before becoming Arsenal manager, said the situation was \"very difficult\".\n\nBut he added: \"I'm not conflicted at all, I want the best or Manchester City, Pep and the players.\n\n\"I feel for them because I know they are suffering. The only thing I want for them is positive and good things.\"\n\nArsenal are in 10th place, six points behind Tottenham, after their 4-0 win over Newcastle on Sunday.\n\nIf the example of Red Star Belgrade is any guide, the fifth-placed team in the Premier League could benefit, should City be excluded from European competition.\n\nRed Star were banned from the 2014-15 Champions League by Uefa for Financial Fair Play breaches. Partizan Belgrade, who finished second behind Red Star in the Serbian League, were elevated to the Champions League from the Europa League.\n\nThe Premier League has not commented on Friday's Uefa, decision but its Financial Fair Play Rules are similar to Uefa's, and City's situation has been a topic of discussion among member clubs.\n\nShould the Premier League decide to bring a charge against City, it can ask Uefa for permission to look at the evidence the European body has used.\n\nUefa imposed its penalty after City were found to have broken the rules by \"overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to Uefa between 2012 and 2016\".\n\nMourinho joked that that while he had little interest in following City's case, it would be piqued if retrospective action led to Manchester United retrospectively being awarded the 2017-18 Premier League title.\n\nThat season, Mourinho's United finished second, 19 points behind their neighbours, with the Portuguese manager previously saying it was \"one of my greatest achievements\".\n\n\"I didn't lose one single minute analysing what Uefa and Fifa have to analyse,\" Mourinho said.\n\n\"If I got into that I have to ask if the team that finished second in 2018 is going to be champions? Yes or no?\n\n\"That would be interesting - but jokes apart, I just wait calmly. I don't think about four or five, just do the best we can, [try to get] the most points we can, the best position we can.\n\n\"At the end of the season, we will see where we are because maybe we are sixth or seventh and then it doesn't matter if fifth goes to the Champions League.\"",

Tesla was, however, granted permission by Germany's environment ministry to begin site preparations \"at its own risk\".\n\nThis has involved clearing about 91 hectares (225 acres) of forest and the felling of thousands of trees - something that outraged an alliance of environmentalists called the Green League.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, the court representing the Berlin and Brandenburg region cautioned: \"It should not be assumed that the motion seeking legal protection brought by the Green League lacks any chance of succeeding.\"\n\nTesla bought almost 300 hectares (the size of more than 400 football pitches) in Gr\u00fcnheide from the state of Brandenburg to build the factory, which is scheduled to open in 2021. Tesla has ambitions to produce up to 500,000 cars a year at the factory, employing about 12,000 people.\n\nBut the company is in a race to get production up and running as Germany's big motor manufacturers are investing heavily in new electric car technology.\n\nAccording to local media reports, Tesla has promised to relocate colonies of forest ants, reptiles and bats, and is working with conservationists. Last month, authorities defused seven Second World War bombs discovered at the site.\n\nTesla currently has two Gigafactories in the US and one in Shanghai, China.",

    "title": "Human compost funerals 'better for environment'",
    "body": "A US firm has given scientific details of its \"human composting\" process for environmentally friendly funerals.\n\nA pilot study on deceased volunteers showed that soft tissue broke down safely and completely within 30 days.\n\nThe firm, Recompose, claims that its process saves more than a tonne of carbon, compared to cremation or traditional burial.\n\nIt says that it will offer the world's first human composting service in Washington state from next February.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to BBC News, Recompose's chief executive and founder, Katrina Spade, said that concerns about climate change had been a big factor in so many people expressing interest in the service.\n\n\"So far 15,000 people have signed up to our newsletter. And the legislation to allow this in the state received bi-partisan support enabling it to pass the first time it was tabled,\" she said.\n\n\"The project has moved forward so quickly because of the urgency of climate change and the awareness we have to put it right.\"\n\nMs Spade spoke to me as results of the scientific study into the composting process, which Recompose calls natural organic reduction, was being presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Seattle.\n\n\"There is a loving practicability to it,\" she said, in one of the few interviews she has given since announcing details of the project a year ago.\n\nShe told me that she came up with the idea 13 years ago when she began to ponder her own mortality - at the ripe old age of 30!\n\n\"When I die, this planet, which has protected and supported me my whole life, shouldn't I give back what I have left?\n\n\"It is just logical and also beautiful.\"\n\nMs Spade draws a distinction between decomposing and recomposing. The former is what happens when a body is above ground. Recomposing involves integrating it with the soil.\n\nShe claims that natural organic reduction of a body prevents 1.4 tonnes of carbon being released into the atmosphere, compared with cremation. And she believes there is a similar saving compared to traditional burial when transportation and the construction of the casket is taken into account.\n\n\"For a lot of folks it resonates with the way they try to lead their lives. They want to pick a death care plan that resonates with the way they live.\"\n\nThe process involves laying the body in a closed vessel with woodchips, alfalfa and straw grass. The body is slowly rotated to allow microbes to break it down.\n\nThirty days later the remains are available to relatives to scatter on plants or a tree.\n\nAlthough the process is straightforward, it has taken four years of scientific research to perfect the technique. Ms Spade asked soil scientist Prof Lynne Carpenter Boggs to undertake the work.\n\nComposting livestock is a well-established practice in Washington state. Prof Carpenter Boggs's task was to adapt it for human subjects and ensure that the remains were environmentally safe.\n\nShe carried out pilot studies with six volunteers who had given their enthusiastic consent to the research prior to their deaths. She told me that the work took an emotional toll on her and her team.\n\n\"We all kept checking in on each other. My physiology felt different, I wasn't sleeping well for a few nights, I wasn't hungry - it was a distress response.\"\n\nProf Carpenter-Boggs found that the recomposing body reached temperatures of 55C (131F) for a period of time.\n\n\"We are certain that there has been a destruction of the vast majority of [disease-causing organisms] and pharmaceuticals because of the high temperatures that we reached.\"\n\nRecompose will begin business later this year. Anyone can participate but the process is legal only in Washington state. Legislation to allow natural organic reduction is currently being considered in Colorado. Ms Spade believes that it will be a matter of time before it is more widely available - in the US and elsewhere.\n\n\"We hope other states will pick up the idea once we get going in Washington. We have had lots of excitement from the UK and other parts of the world and we hope to open branches overseas when we can.\"",

    "title": "Arsenal 4-0 Newcastle: Gunners beat Magpies to end run of draws",
    "body": "Arsenal picked up just their seventh Premier League victory of the season with a confidence-boosting thrashing of Newcastle at Emirates Stadium.\n\nThe Gunners have been the division's draw specialists this campaign having been held 13 times and it looked to be going the same way after a goalless first half.\n\nBut the hosts sprung into action immediately after the restart with Eddie Nketiah's no-look strike from Nicolas Pepe's cutback clipping the top of the crossbar.\n\nMikel Arteta's side broke the deadlock on 54 minutes through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's well-placed header and Pepe doubled the lead just three minutes later with a neat, first-time finish.\n\nMesut Ozil poked in a third late on from substitute Alexandre Lacazette's pass and the Frenchman converted a fourth in injury-time.\n\nNewcastle attempted to play further forward after conceding but were restricted to few opportunities - the dangerous Allan Saint-Maximin coming closest with a curling strike that rattled the post.\n\nArsenal's win moves them up into the top half of the table in 10th place - six points behind north London rivals Tottenham, who claimed a last-gasp winner over Aston Villa to go fifth.\n\nArsenal have suffered a wretched season in the top-flight, 16 points and six places worse off than at this stage under Unai Emery last season.\n\nA poor start this term led to the Spaniard's dismissal and although they had lost just once under replacement Arteta, they had drawn seven games since his appointment in December.\n\nBefore the game, only the bottom two sides Watford (5) and Norwich (4) had won fewer games than Arsenal and even this victory was not plain sailing. There were plenty of groans from the home supporters when it looked like their side were still shaking off the comforts of their winter break in Dubai as they demonstrated a lack of cohesion in the final third.\n\nBukayo Saka curled narrowly wide, Pepe had a free-kick tipped over by Martin Dubravka and Shkodran Mustafi saw his hooked shot headed off the line by Joelinton.\n\nBut Arsenal came out with renewed focus in the second half and scored twice before the hour mark to put the game to bed - Aubameyang powering in a header for his 15th league goal of the campaign from Pepe's hanging cross.\n\nAnd it was Pepe, the club's \u00a372m record signing, who turned from provider to goalscorer following sublime work by Saka, who nutmegged Valentino Lazaro and provided the perfect cross for him to tuck home.\n\nAubameyang could have further extended his tally for the season but his cross-come-shot landed on top of the crossbar.\n\nJust when it looked like the game was coming to a subdued close Arsenal scored twice more for a thumping win - Ozil's effort squirming through the hands of Dubravka - following a move that involved 35 passes and all 11 players touching the ball - and Lacazette added gloss to the scoreline.\n\nSheffield United in sixth-place will now be in their sights, as they aim to avoid finishing outside the top-six for the first time in 25 years, while they also remain in both the FA Cup and Europa League competitions.\n\nThe appointment of Steve Bruce as Newcastle boss to replace the popular Rafael Benitez was not universally well-received by the club's supporters but the ex-Manchester United defender has responded to critics with a decent debut campaign.\n\nThe Tynesiders lie 12th in the table, seven points clear of the drop zone having been just one point outside the relegation place at this stage last term, but this heavy loss was a big setback for the visitors.\n\nBruce's defensive plan with five-at-the-back did not work on this occasion as they were picked off by Arsenal's front foot pressure and finishing in key moments.\n\nBut it is at the other end of the pitch where they really struggle, they have scored just 24 times, with only Crystal Place less prolific.\n\nIn Joelinton - the club's record \u00a340m signing from Hoffenheim - they have a striker who has netted just once in the league and is on a run of 22 games and 1,856 minutes without a goal.\n\nThe Brazilian works hard for the team but he lacks goals and also touches inside the opposition penalty area - just three of his 47 came in the 18-yard box.\n\nOne chance did fall to him in the first-half when he was unmarked eight yards out, but his flicked effort at the near post drifted off target.\n\nFull-back Lazaro, a recent loan signing from Inter Milan, impressed, winning the ball back three times and providing an outlet on the flank, while on the other side of the pitch Danny Rose made more passes (42) than any team-mate despite the constant jeers from the home fans for his Tottenham links.\n\nThe lively Saint-Maximin was unlucky with his effort that struck the woodwork, while Sean Longstaff's deflected volley was pushed away by Bernd Leno.\n\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta to BBC Sport: \"After the break we started saying we had to start closing the gap on the top teams and turn draws into wins. Today was the first opportunity and we've done it. All good.\n\n\"I'm so pleased for Laca [Alexandra Lacazette] - the reaction of the players and staff towards him. He fights hard for everyone. He's been unlucky. He will gain confidence from this and knows how everyone appreciates him.\"\n\nArsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang speaking to Sky Sports: \"We started not at our best but in the second half we put some more energy in and we scored the goals.\n\n\"We spoke at half-time and the coach told me to stay as a second striker and take my position off Eddie [Nketiah]. They were playing very deep and compact so it was good for us to have me in the middle to give more space out wide.\"\n\nNewcastle boss Steve Bruce speaking to Sky Sports: \"The disappointing thing is the goals we gave away are not like us. They were too easy. For an hour we were where we have been all season. We switched off from that and gave away sloppy goals.\n\n\"I was delighted with the way we played in the first half. We made the wrong pass or selection when we [attacked]. Second half, we knew they would come with more intensity and we didn't start well.\n\n\"We've played well enough in the first half - we have to try and keep to those levels but we didn't get anyway near it in the second half. When you get a beating like you have, you have to lick your wounds and get on with it.\"\n\nArsenal's attentions now turn to the Europa League and Olympiakos, who they face on Thursday (20:00 GMT), before they return to Premier League action next Sunday against Everton (16:30).\n\nMeanwhile, Newcastle are next in action next Saturday, when they travel to Crystal Palace in the Premier League (15:00).",

    "title": "Kilmarnock 1-2 Hibernian: Jack Ross' men cling on for win",
    "body": "Hibernian moved to within five points of third place in the Scottish Premiership after battling to a win over Kilmarnock at Rugby Park.\n\nAnd Jack Ross' men also edged four points clear of their seventh-placed hosts with two victories from two.\n\nHibs midfielder Greg Docherty's stunning strike lit up the first half, and Adam Jackson restored the lead after Chris Burke had levelled.\n\nKilmarnock pressed but could not make a series of corner kicks count.\n\nAnd the defeat brought to an end a run of four games unbeaten for Alex Dyer's men.\n\nThe incentive was there to affirm top six credentials and extinguish any lingering unlikely threat of being dragged into trouble.\n\nIt was Hibernian that prospered but boy did they have to earn it against a Kilmarnock side who were so committed but somehow could not find an equaliser.\n\nThe home side did seem to have an edge going forward but it was the visitors who threatened first when both Joe Newell and Vykintas Slivka had efforts well blocked.\n\nThen Martin Boyle curled in a delivery which Marc McNulty hit towards goal. The ball was blocked and spun on the touchline with the wind unexpectedly holding it up, which was to prove crucial.\n\nThat allowed Joe Newell to recycle the ball to Docherty, who dispatched a superb effort from an angle which found the top corner.\n\nDocherty has made quite the impression since joining on loan from Rangers, perhaps more than manager Jack Ross may have hoped for. It was a sensational effort to add to his impressive all round game and gave Hibernian the platform for victory.\n\nThe home side hit back immediately. Gary Dicker showed presence of mind to pick out Niko Hamalainen in the penalty area. His centre caused chaos before the ball broke to Burke to stoop and place a header low into the corner.\n\nBut Hibernian regained the lead when a free-kick from the right deflected favourably after McNulty got a touch. Jackson was on hand to strike the ball off the surface and over Jan Koprivec. It was a crucial strike at a crucial time.\n\nKilmarnock tried to force the issue from the off in the second period, generating substantial pressure.\n\nBrophy had an effort blocked then shot tamely with Ofir Marciano exposed. Stephen O'Donnell then got in but his rasping drive was tipped over. Rory Mackenzie was next but could not get the final touch when in on Marciano.\n\nTime after time, through Burke in particular, Kilmarnock sent in quality deliveries that were repelled on each occasion. And they also had a strong shout for a late penalty when Jackson appeared to hold Dario Del Fabro but referee Alan Muir failed to see it.\n\nHibernian survived what became an onslaught and will be thrilled to have advanced their position in the top six.",

However, they are not typically shared publicly.\n\nThe newspaper claims that an unsecured website contained 19 files including plans for \"every area of the event space's buildings room by room\", including things like sprinkler valve rooms and the power hub.\n\nAbout 30,000 people, including some 200 world leaders, are expected to attend COP26.\n\nPolice Scotland has previously warned that the cost of providing security could be more than \u00a3200m - partly because the force will need to bring in officers from elsewhere in the UK to help.\n\nA spokeswoman for the UK government said: \"We are continuing to work very closely with Police Scotland and the relevant authorities to ensure COP26 is a secure and welcoming event for all participants.\"\n\nThe Scottish government said it had been made aware of the issue by the UK government but that it was confident the event would be secure and welcoming.\n\nThe conference is due to be held at the Scottish Events Campus between 9 and 19 November, but there have been concerns about spiralling costs amid claims that the UK and Scottish governments have been at loggerheads over planning for the event.",

    "body": "Forty Americans being taken off the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess are infected with new coronavirus, a US official says.\n\nThey are among 400 people from the US leaving the vessel docked in Japan.\n\nMost are due to depart for the US on two government-chartered aircraft. But those carrying the virus will be admitted to Japanese hospitals.\n\nMeanwhile, China has tightened restrictions on movement in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak.\n\nThe Diamond Princess has been quarantined in Japan's port of Yokohama with some 3,400 people on board since 3 February after a man left the ship in Hong Kong and was found to have the virus.\n\nIt has the largest cluster of coronavirus cases outside China. The Japanese authorities on Sunday said the number of new cases on board the ship had risen by 70 to 355.\n\nThe 40 Americans who are infected will receive medical treatment in Japan, Dr Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told Face the Nation on CBS.\n\n\"Others are going to be evacuated, starting imminently, to Air Force bases in the United States,\" he said.\n\n\"If people on the plane start to develop symptoms, they'll be segregated within the plane.\"\n\nThose entering the US will undergo a 14-day quarantine, he added.\n\n\"And the reason for that is that the degree of transmissibility, on that cruise ship, is essentially akin to being in a hotspot.\"\n\nOther evacuation flights will repatriate residents of Israel, Hong Kong and Canada on the ship.\n\nPeople in the province of 60 million have been ordered to stay at home, though they will be allowed to leave in an emergency. In addition, a single person from each household will be allowed to leave the building every three days to buy food and essential items.\n\nOn housing estates, one entrance will be kept open. It will be guarded to ensure that only residents can enter or leave.\n\nAll other businesses will stay closed, except chemists, hotels, food shops and medical services.\n\nThere will be a ban on the use of private cars, but vehicles used for the delivery of essential goods are exempt.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities in the capital, Beijing, have ordered everyone returning to the city to go into quarantine for 14 days or risk punishment.\n\nChina's central bank will also disinfect and store used banknotes before recirculating them in a bid to stop the virus spreading.\n\nOn Sunday, the Chinese authorities reported 2,009 new cases - down from 2,641 on Saturday, and 5,090 the day before.\n\nNew cases spiked earlier in the week after a change in the way they were counted but have been falling ever since. In total, more than 68,500 people have so far been infected in China.\n\nNational Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said the figures showed China was managing to curb the outbreak.\n\n\"The effects of epidemic prevention and control in various parts of the country can already be seen.\"\n\nThe commission's daily bulletin also reported 142 more deaths nationwide, the vast majority in Hubei.\n\nHowever Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that along with a drop in infections within Hubei there had been a rapid increase in the number of people who had recovered.\n\nThe proportion of infected patients considered to be in a \"serious condition\" has dropped nationwide from more than 15% to just over 7%, according to China's State Council.\n\nTaiwan has now reported a death from the illness - a taxi driver, 61, who had not travelled abroad recently but had diabetes and hepatitis B, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said.\n\nThe minister said many of his passengers had come from China.\n\nOutside China, there have been more than 500 cases in nearly 30 countries. Four others have died outside China - in France, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan.\n\nMeanwhile, a plane carrying 175 evacuated Nepalis, mostly students, has arrived in Kathmandu from Wuhan. It is the latest country to fly its citizens out of Hubei province.\n\nThe virus is a new strain of coronavirus and causes an acute respiratory disease which has been named Covid-19.",

It'll be a case of calling the landlord and calling the insurers and see what happens after that.\n\n\"For us, it's a case of the unknown at this stage.\"\n\nBBC News NI reporter Richard Morgan, who went to the scene, said the incident appeared to have happened without warning.\n\n\"One woman, I've been speaking to, said she walked along here just seconds before, and got into her car. She was visibly shaken and says she had a lucky escape.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Republic of Ireland's weather service, Met \u00c9ireann, has issued an orange wind warning for nine counties.\n\nThe warning covers Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Sligo, Clare, Cork, Kerry and Limerick and will remain in place until 22:00 local time on Sunday.\n\nStorm Dennis descended on the UK on Saturday, bringing a month's worth of rainfall to some of the worst-hit areas.\n\nThe Army was deployed to help with flood relief in some areas with severe disruption to road, rail and air travel.\n\nOn Sunday major incidents were declared in south Wales and parts of England, as Storm Dennis continues to batter the UK.\n\nDyfed Powys Police said a man had been found dead after falling into the River Tawe, while South Wales Police said it was dealing with \"multiple\" landslides and floods - some trapping residents.\n\nDisruption has been much less severe in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland has said that multi-agency partners stand ready to respond to disruption and instances of flooding.\n\nIn Londonderry, high-sided vehicles are barred from using the Foyle Bridge while all other vehicles must keep to a 30mph maximum speed limit.\n\nRoad users have been advised to check the latest traffic information on the Trafficwatch website.\n\nIf you are affected by flooding, then it can be reported to the flooding incident line on 0300 2000 100. You can also check information on flooding in your area via the NI Direct website.\n\nStorm Dennis was the fourth locally-named storm of the winter season after Storm Atiyah in December, Storm Brendan last month and Storm Ciara earlier in February.",

    "body": "Holders Manchester City hit 10 goals past fourth-tier Ipswich Town to reach the Women's FA Cup quarter-finals for seventh straight year.\n\nPauline Bremer, Jess Park and Georgia Stanway all scored hat-tricks for the Women's Super League leaders.\n\nThey will be joined in the last eight by 2012 winners Birmingham City, who edged past third-tier Sunderland.\n\nBirmingham's 1-0 win came courtesy of England midfielder Lucy Staniforth's late free-kick against her old club.\n\nSunday's remaining three fixtures were postponed because of severe weather caused by Storm Dennis, while Chelsea and Liverpool's tie - originally scheduled for Sunday too - was pre-emptively moved to Monday about 48 hours earlier.\n\nThe draw for the quarter-finals will be made on Monday, live on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club programme at 20:45 GMT.\n\nThe elimination of Ipswich and 2016 semi-finalists Sunderland meant there will be no sides from below the top two divisions involved in Monday's draw.\n\nThe Lady Black Cats - who are top of the third tier's Northern region - impressed against top-flight Birmingham, who were reduced to 10 players with five minutes to go as Staniforth was sent off shortly after breaking the deadlock with her fine free-kick from range.\n\nNational League Division One South East outfit Ipswich, who had won six matches to get to the last-16 stage in the competition and were the lowest-ranked team remaining, named seven teenagers in their starting XI, which had an average age of 21.\n\nIn contrast, Manchester City fielded 10 senior internationals, along with England youth international Park, and were ultimately ruthlessly dominant.\n\nThe visitors were backed by more than 400 noisy travelling fans from Suffolk but trailed early on to Laura Coombs' opening goal on the counter-attack and the midfielder's effort was added to by Germany's Bremer and Park to give the hosts a 3-0 half-time lead.\n\nBremer, Park and Lionesses forward Stanway all completed their hat-tricks after the break, as interim boss Alan Mahon made it two wins from his two games in charge since Nick Cushing left to take up a job in the United States.",

We changed and went to a 4-3-3 and it seemed to put Aberdeen out of shape a bit.\"\n\nCallum McGregor gave Celtic an early lead, but Aberdeen's Ash Taylor fired the home side level.\n\nMcInnes' men littered the Celtic box with crosses but could not find a second, and on the counter attack the visitors restored their lead in the final 10 minutes through Norwegian defender Ajer.\n\nIt proves a huge boost in the build up to Thursday's trip to Copenhagen in the last 32 of the Europa League.\n\n\"That's all credit to the players today, they had to be resilient at times, they had to be strong and defend set plays well,\" Lennon told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"That's exactly what I want from my team, it's not always about painting pretty pictures all the time, sometimes you have to dig in.\n\n\"Other results are out with our control, we've just got to concentrate on ourselves and not get carried away.\n\n\"We're happy and we'll enjoy the trip home, but we've got a big game coming up on Thursday and a huge game next Sunday away to Kilmarnock.\"",

    "body": "French police have arrested a woman in connection with the release of a sex video that brought down a political ally of President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAlexandra de Taddeo is the girlfriend of activist Petr Pavlensky. Both were detained on Saturday but police did not initially reveal her arrest.\n\nShe was arrested on charges of invasion of privacy and distributing personal images without consent, officials said.\n\nThe video scuppered Benjamin Griveaux's candidacy for mayor of Paris.\n\nIt was published on a little-known website that alleged Mr Griveaux, 42, had exchanged intimate mobile phone messages and footage with a young woman.\n\nMs de Taddeo is suspected of being the recipient of the intimate footage, France's Le Figaro newspaper reported on Sunday, quoting the Paris prosecutor's office.\n\nMr Pavlensky, a Russian who sought asylum in France in 2017, earlier said that he was responsible for posting the video, which showed a man involved in a sexual act.\n\nHe was detained on Saturday as part of a separate investigation into an alleged brawl in Paris on 31 December involving \"wilful violence with a weapon\".\n\nProsecutors later said that Ms de Taddeo, whom he had reportedly been in a relationship with since January 2019, was being held over the widely condemned release of the footage of Mr Griveaux.\n\nThe politician had filed an invasion of privacy complaint hours before she was detained.\n\nThe distribution of the clip, which spread quickly across social media last Thursday, brought condemnation from across the political spectrum.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo said people's private lives should be respected.\n\nFar-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon condemned the video's release as \"odious\", while far-right leader Marine Le Pen suggested Mr Griveaux should not have quit.\n\nMr Pavlensky has said he posted the video to expose what he sees as the politician's hypocrisy.\n\nMr Griveaux, who is married with children and was once a government spokesman, condemned the distribution of the video as he withdrew his mayoral candidacy on Friday.\n\n\"My family does not deserve this. No-one should ever be subjected to such abuse,\" he said.\n\nOn Sunday, French Health Minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn said she would be replacing Mr Griveaux as the En Marche party's candidate for mayor of Paris.\n\nThe 35-year-old first gained notoriety by nailing his scrotum to Moscow's Red Square in 2013. He fled Russia and sought asylum in France when he was accused by the authorities of a sexual assault that he denied.\n\nHe served seven months in jail for setting the front door of the FSB intelligence agency on fire in Moscow and later caused minor damage to a Banque de France branch by setting that alight.\n\nBefore his arrest, he told French news channel LCI that Mr Griveaux was only the first politician that he would target, saying he would carry on fighting the \"propaganda and puritanism of politicians\".\n\nFrench media have traditionally avoided prying into the private lives of people in public life and a number of figures have referred distastefully to the \"Americanisation\" of politics.",

    "body": "Cavan boosted their Division Two survival hopes with an impressive 3-10 to 1-06 victory away to Laois in the Football League at O'Moore Park.\n\nEoin Lowry scored Laois's goal against the run of play, which was cancelled out by a flurry of Cavan points and Evan Doughty's strike.\n\nStephen Murray added two second-half goals to wrap up the victory.\n\nAfter being tipped for relegation, Cavan now top Division Two along with Armagh and Westmeath after three games.\n\nA series of early points set the tone for the game, which was rearranged after being postponed due to Storm Ciara last weekend, with Oisin Pierson scoring for the visitors either side of Sean Byrne's point from play.\n\nBryan Magee and Gerard Smith extended Cavan's lead, although the hosts did respond through Kieran Lillis.\n\nHowever Laois found the net when Lowry scored after a goalmouth scramble on 21 minutes, with Mark Barry edging the hosts further ahead as the sun began to shine in Portlaoise.\n\nMagee stopped the rot with a free, before parity was restored through Pierson's third score of the game.\n\nCavan were hitting the more consistent scores in an open match, aided by two further points from Smith before Evan Doughty netted to give the Breffnimen a comfortable 1-08 to 1-03 buffer at the interval after Robert Pigott's black card for Laois.\n\nMurray, who was on as a half-time substitute two minutes earlier, scored Cavan's second goal from play before Magee put Mickey Graham's side further in front.\n\nEvan O'Carroll briefly halted the mass of Cavan points with two well-taken scores, but Raymond Gilligan soon restored the eight-point margin.\n\nLaois were unbeaten in their opening two games, and responded once more through John O'Loughlin's point from play but Murray added his second goal of the game in the final minute despite Smith's black card.",

I don't have insurance so I'm left potentially left footing the bill out of my own pocket unless I can get some help with grants.\"\n\nHe added: \"The work on the flood defences here should have finished a long time ago.

    "body": "When Oran Kearney speaks, it's clear the Coleraine players listen.\n\nAnd they will no doubt have liked what they heard from their talismanic manager in the jubilant afterglow of their League Cup final success.\n\n\"We are all brilliant at moving on in life and pushing things to the side quickly, but I want the players to make sure they enjoy this win,\" he reflected.\n\nWith the north coast club well in the hunt for the Irish Premiership title and in the quarter-finals of the Irish Cup, it was perhaps unavoidable that thoughts would turn to what further trophy success they could achieve this season.\n\nKearney was realistic enough to know that talk of a potential treble cannot be brushed aside, but was firm in his thoughts on savouring Saturday night's comeback win over Crusaders at Windsor Park.\n\n\"To be honest, it's not even on the radar at this point in time and I've said that to the players,\" the former St Mirren boss continued.\n\n\"We will meet up on Tuesday night to regroup and train, but between now and then I don't want any of us to talk about anything else but this cup win.\n\n\"We all graft and graft for moments in football like this and it can pass so quickly. It's important that we get that enjoyment from it as a group and with our families.\n\n\"We have players in the squad such as Josh Carson, James McLaughlin and Lyndon Kane who missed the final when we won the Irish Cup in 2018, so they should lap this up and take the emotion with them.\n\n\"Yes, we want this win to be a catalyst but football is too short and that will look after itself further down the line.\"\n\nWhile this was only Kearney's second trophy as Coleraine boss, he had plenty of experience of winning silverware as a player as part of David Jeffrey's all-conquering Linfield side.\n\nHe no doubt drew on that experience in the build-up to Saturday's showpiece, while ensuring the players used their own experiences of back-to-back Irish Cup final appearances in 2017 and 2018.\n\n\"There has certainly been a buzz since we won the semi-final,\" he continued.\n\n\"However, we said to the players all week in the build-up that we are past the hullaballoo and furore that surrounds occasions like this. It's all about the football match, we trained fantastically well and everything was looking good.\n\n\"If you look back to the Irish Cup final a few years ago when we lost to Linfield, it hurt us badly but the learning curve from it was fantastic, and we put it right the following year.\"\n\nThat good week's training in the build-up was not evident in the opening 35 minutes of the final, as Crusaders seized control of the match and led through a Jamie McGonigle goal on 10 minutes.\n\nThe Coleraine fans in the East Stand were hugely vocal from before kick-off and continued throughout the match as Stephen Lowry equalised with a penalty before the break and James McLaughlin headed in the winner not long after half-time.\n\nKearney and his players spent a long time celebrating in front of their travelling supporters after the match, and the manager was effusive in his praise of the role the fans played.\n\n\"Our average home gate is somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000, depending who we are playing, but I think we had 4,000 at Windsor Park,\" he commented.\n\n\"The noise from them was phenomenal from the start. We have to give credit to them because we were on the ropes for parts of the first half, but the noise never stopped the whole time.\"\n\nAs ever, Kearney's message was important and he had another one for his players while praising the fans.\n\n\"Some of those fans may not have been to a Coleraine game since our last cup final, but the important thing is that we have to keep putting on performances and giving them joyous nights like this.\n\n\"That might another 200 or 300 fans on the gate for the rest of the season and that's important for the club.\"",

    "body": "China is tightening curbs on movement in Hubei province as it battles the outbreak of new coronavirus.\n\nSixty-million people have been told to stay at home unless there is an emergency, and the use of private cars has been banned indefinitely.\n\nHubei and the city of Wuhan have been hit hardest by the outbreak, which has now claimed 1,665 lives in China.\n\nBut China has announced a drop in new cases for a third consecutive day and says it is controlling the spread.\n\nThe order to stay at home does have exceptions, such as an emergency. In addition, a single person from each household will be allowed to leave the building every three days to buy food and essential items.\n\nOn housing estates, one entrance will be kept open. It will be guarded to ensure that only residents can enter or leave.\n\nAll other businesses will stay closed, except chemists, hotels, food shops and medical services.\n\nVehicles used for the delivery of essential goods are exempt from the car ban.\n\nForeign Minister Wang Yi also said that along with a drop in infections within Hubei there had been a rapid increase in the number of people who had recovered.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities in the capital, Beijing, have ordered everyone returning to the city to go into quarantine for 14 days or risk punishment.\n\nChina's central bank will also disinfect and store used banknotes before recirculating them in a bid to stop the virus spreading.\n\nOn Sunday, authorities reported 2,009 new cases - down from 2,641 on Saturday, and 5,090 the day before.\n\nNew cases spiked earlier in the week after a change in the way they were counted but have been falling ever since. In total 68,500 people have so far been infected in China.\n\nNational Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said the figures showed China was managing to curb the outbreak.\n\n\"The effects of epidemic prevention and control in various parts of the country can already be seen.\"\n\nThe commission's daily bulletin also reported 142 more deaths nationwide, the vast majority in Hubei.\n\nThe proportion of infected patients considered to be in a \"serious condition\" has dropped nationwide from more than 15% to just over 7%, according to China's State Council.\n\nTaiwan has now reported a death from the illness - a man, 61, who had not travelled abroad recently but had diabetes and hepatitis B, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said.\n\nThe minister said many of the driver's passengers had come from China.\n\nOutside China there have been more than 500 cases in nearly 30 countries. Four others have died outside China - in France, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan.\n\nIn another development Chinese state media published a speech from earlier this month in which Chinese President Xi Jinping said he said he had given instructions on 7 January on containing the outbreak.\n\nAt the time, local officials in the city of Wuhan were downplaying the severity of the epidemic.\n\nThis would suggest senior leaders were aware of the potential dangers of the virus before the information was made public.\n\nWith the government facing criticism for its handling of the outbreak, analysts suggest the disclosure is an attempt to show the party leadership acted decisively from the start.",

Chelsea are moving in the right direction quicker. The \u00a338m move for Hakim Ziyech has Blues fans licking their lips. United supporters have been underwhelmed over the arrival of Odion Ighalo.\n\nThey need goals from someone but he hasn't played since 1 December, and didn't even meet his team-mates until this weekend after quarantined training precautions.\n\nChelsea are in danger of a fourth league game without a win for the first time since May 2016 at the start of a defining period for Frank Lampard's first season - with Spurs and Bayern to come.\n\nBut the arrival of Ziyech is really exciting. He'll be a terrific signing, and a Chelsea win should kill off United's top four hopes.\n\nChelsea head coach Frank Lampard on dropping Kepa Arrizabalaga last weekend: \"It wasn't about giving him a jolt. It was just a selection on that day.\n\n\"I want everyone's reaction spot on. I know how it will feel for him. I had it in my career, it is part and parcel.

    "title": "Aberdeen 1-2 Celtic: Ajer goal settles scrappy Pittodrie game",
    "body": "Celtic stretched their winning run to nine games as Kristoffer Ajer's late goal earned a Scottish Premiership victory against a battling Aberdeen.\n\nNeil Lennnon's men moved 13 points clear at the top of the table after a seventh consecutive league win - with Rangers v Livingston later on Sunday.\n\nBut the champions were largely subdued for much of the 90 minutes.\n\nAsh Taylor cancelled out Celtic's Callum McGregor's opener, before Ajer settled it late on.\n\nIt was Aberdeen's best display at home to Celtic for some time, but they have now lost the last eight home meetings with the Parkhead team.\n\nAberdeen ended a drought of five games without a goal in midweek against Hamilton and in the opening period they certainly looked like a team who could pose the champions problems.\n\nConnor McLennan and Niall McGinn looked lively and Curtis Main was proving a handful for the Celtic trio at the back.\n\nHowever it was the visitors who opened the scoring with their first real attack of the game. Leigh Griffiths got the better of defender Scott Mckenna and slid the ball into the path of Odsonne Edouard. The Celtic striker fed the onrushing James Forrest who was denied by goalkeeper Joe Lewis, but McGregor followed up with the rebound for his 11th goal of the season.\n\nBut Aberdeen were level when Lewis Ferguson's cross was flicked on by Matty Kennedy into the path of Taylor, who chested the ball down before despatching it beyond the helpless Fraser Forster.\n\nAberdeen were playing with a confidence that the home fans had rarely seen evidence of this season, and Funso Ojo and McGinn both threatened before the break.\n\nCeltic's record of not dropping points after taking the lead this season was under threat with the windy conditions proving troublesome for both sets of players, but the home side were marginally coping the better.\n\nBefore Lennon tweaked his formation, Celtic had a golden opportunity to regain the lead when Edouard set up Jonny Hayes who was clean through on goal before being denied by his former team-mate Lewis.\n\nAberdeen were always dangerous though, and Mckenna got his head on a cross ball that he would have been better leaving with Main in a much better position to find the target.\n\nAnd Celtic then did what they do so well with a goal against the run of play. Forrest sent a perfect pass into the path of Ajer who took one touch before firing past Lewis.\n\nEdouard could have sealed the victory with Lewis languishing on the ground, but from just two yards out the striker hit the ball off the goalkeeper and the opportunity was gone.\n\nIn the end it was a score that was harsh on Aberdeen who had put so much into the game, but ended up with nothing to show for their efforts.\n\nAlthough it was a Celtic victory it was the Aberdeen players who caught the eye on an afternoon where silky football was definitely not on the agenda.\n\nFerguson and McLennan gave their all but McGinn tormented the Celtic backline from the first minute to the last and although he ended up in the losing side he can be pleased with his performance overall.",

    "body": "A visibly upset Sir Elton John has been forced to cut short a concert in New Zealand after falling ill with walking pneumonia.\n\nThe musician, 72, lost his voice mid-way through his set at Auckland's Mount Smart Stadium on Sunday.\n\n\"I've just completely lost my voice. I can't sing,\" Sir Elton told the crowd. \"I've got to go. I'm sorry.\"\n\nSir Elton appeared to break down in tears as he leaned on his piano and shook his head.\n\nThe audience gave the English singer a rapturous ovation as he walked gingerly off stage, helped by several assistants.\n\nEarlier in his set, Sir Elton told the sold-out crowd he had been diagnosed with walking pneumonia on Sunday.\n\nThe concert was one of a number of New Zealand shows on Sir Elton's Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour.\n\nWalking pneumonia, also called atypical pneumonia, is a type of lung infection often caused by bacteria or viruses.\n\nIt is less severe than other types of pneumonia, with most sufferers not requiring medical attention. Symptoms are comparable to those of a bad cold, often including a cough, chest pain, a sore throat and a headache.\n\nSir Elton was checked by a medic halfway through the show and, despite his illness, was able to perform classics such as Candle in the Wind and All the Girls Love Alice.\n\nBut ultimately, he was unable to finish the set, his voice giving way as he attempted to sing Daniel.\n\nShortly after leaving the stage, Sir Elton apologised to his fans in an emotional Instagram post.\n\n\"I played and sang my heart out, until my voice could sing no more. I'm disappointed, deeply upset and sorry. I gave it all I had. Thank you so much for your extraordinary support and all the love you showed me during tonight's performance. I am eternally grateful. Love, Elton xx,\" he wrote.\n\nOn social media, concertgoers expressed sympathy for the singer, who remains one of the world's most in-demand live performers.\n\nSir Elton John announced in 2018 that he would stop touring in order to prioritise his family. But he announced he would say goodbye to fans with a series of 300 dates spanning three years.\n\nIt is not clear what effect Sir Elton's illness will have on upcoming tour dates.\n\nThe star is scheduled to play two more concerts in Auckland on Tuesday and Thursday as part of the tour.",

    "title": "Russian activist sets FSB door on fire",
    "body": "A Russian artist and political activist has been arrested after setting fire to the Moscow headquarters of the country's security service, the FSB.\n\nPyotr Pavlensky set the door of the Lubyanka building alight and was pictured standing in front of the blaze holding a petrol can.\n\nMr Pavlensky was arrested in 2013 after he nailed his scrotum to the floor of Moscow's Red Square in protest.\n\nThe Lubyanka building is the historical home of Russia's security services.\n\nThe imposing building was used by the country's secret police and later KGB - the forerunner to the FSB - and contains a prison.\n\nMr Pavlensky has been questioned on suspicion of vandalism, a charge that carries a jail sentence of up to three years.\n\nTwo journalists who filmed the performance were taken in for questioning, Russian media reported.\n\nThe performance artist released a video of the stunt, and said in a statement: \"The FSB acts using a method of uninterrupted terror and maintains power over 146 million people.\n\n\"Fear turns free people into a sticky mass of uncoordinated bodies,\" he added.\n\n\"The threat of inevitable reprisal hangs over everyone who can be tracked with devices, have their conversations listened to, or at borders with passport checks.\"\n\nInspired or crazy, creative artist or cheap stunt man, Pyotr Pavlensky divides opinion but rarely leaves Russians indifferent. Thanks to the shock factor of his art he is well known here and his latest work is perhaps his most audacious. On social media, some have praised his challenge to the powerful FSB as \"courageous\" and \"heroic\" - a fellow performance artist of Pussy Riot fame proclaimed Pavlensky the \"mind, conscience and balls\" of the age.\n\nBut there's criticism too. State TV anchorman Vladimir Solovyov dismissed all talk of the fire as art. If someone set fire to an opposition leader's office, not the FSB, that would instantly be seen as a \"terrorist act against freedom\", he said.\n\nSurprisingly perhaps, Mr Pavlensky has only been prosecuted once before. That trial for vandalism is still ongoing but it clearly hasn't deterred him. When prosecutors tried to force him to undergo psychiatric testing, the artist stripped naked, mounted the wall of a famous psychiatric institute and lopped-off part of his ear lobe.\n\nMr Pavlensky hit the headlines in 2013 after nailing his scrotum to the cobblestone of Red Square to protest against tight police control.\n\nHe has previously sewed his lips shut to protest against the arrest of the band Pussy Riot, cut off part of his earlobe in a protest over the forced psychiatric treatment of dissidents, and wrapped his naked body in a \"cocoon\" of barbed wire outside Russia's parliament building.\n\nThe artist is facing three years in prison over a 2014 performance in St Petersburg, in which activists set fire to tyres and waved a Ukrainian flag to simulate the Maidan protests that led to the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Moscow leader, Viktor Yanukovych.",

    "body": "The DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in have said the Treasury should fund pension-like payments to victims of the Troubles.\n\nWestminster passed laws last year to provide a new compensation scheme but it will be administered by the Stormont Executive.\n\nEarlier this month, First Minister Arlene Foster said that the NI budget could not fund the scheme, which she said could cost up to \u00a360m.\n\nGerry Kelly told the BBC that the government \"has to deal with it\".\n\nSpeaking on the BBC Northern Ireland's Sunday Politics programme, the Sinn F\u00e9in MLA added: \"There's people been waiting for this pension for a considerable period of time.\n\n\"The political decision has been made to give a pension, we need to move on that basis.\n\n\"So they can't now say, 'we've made this decision, but now it's going to cost too much'.\n\n\"The British government have to deal with it.\"\n\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson said he hoped the Executive will make the case at Westminster for the funding.\n\n\"The events that gave rise to the pensions that will be paid to innocent victims happened during a time of direct rule,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it would be wrong to put paying that compensation on the Northern Ireland Executive. It doesn't have the budget for this. The money for the Executive comes from the Treasury so ultimately this does go back to the Treasury.\"\n\nA judge-led board will decide who will qualify for the new scheme for people who were injured during the Troubles.\n\nFormer Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith signed legislation in January to establish the scheme for people injured \"through no fault of their own\".\n\nMost people will be assessed on medical records, but face-to-face assessments will be used if this is not possible.\n\nPayments will range from \u00a32,000 to \u00a310,000 every year for the rest of a victim's life.\n\nThere will also be provisions to extend payments to those who care for Troubles victims for more than 35 hours a week.\n\nThe Troubles claimed more than 3,500 lives and the Northern Ireland Office has estimated that a further 40,000 people were injured.\n\nEligible victims will have to apply for the payments, and the scheme will open for applications by the end of May 2020.",

    "title": "Six Nations: Paul Grayson assesses England, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, France and Italy",
    "body": "With two rounds done, the Six Nations squads are in the midst of a rest week, nursing injuries and refining gameplans.\n\nWith four head coaches making their debut in the competition ,though, who is top of the class and who must try harder at this point?\n\nFormer England fly-half and BBC Radio 5 Live analyst Paul Grayson is here to hand out his half-term report card.\n\nAfter the run to the Rugby World Cup campaign, losing away in France without really firing a shot was very disappointing. England were just so ineffective.\n\nI think coach Eddie Jones has made a few selection mistakes with his squad as well, leaving himself without much wriggle room if he gets injuries in certain areas.\n\nFor instance, George Furbank is probably his third- or fourth-choice full-back but, with a couple of injuries, he was thrust into the first team.\n\nIt is too early to call the experiment with Tom Curry playing at number eight in Billy Vunipola's enforced absence. It didn't work in the opening game in France. He was better in the second game, but the conditions really made that game such an oddity.\n\nI would have liked to have seen a specialist number eight in the squad - either Harlequins' Alex Dombrandt or Exeter's Sam Simmonds.\n\nFor all that, though, the big caveat is that when England perform well we know that they are more than a match for anyone.\n\nGrade: C-\n\nWales are probably the team that have changed the most under a new coach.\n\nWayne Pivac has made a decent capture in convincing former England under-20 centre Nick Tomkins to commit himself to Wales, even if the harsh realities of Test rugby caught up with him against Ireland somewhat after his try-scoring debut against Italy.\n\nPivac also seems keen to get Wales playing a more adventurous gameplan, similar to the one which he used to guide Scarlets to the Pro12 title in 2017.\n\nThere is a similar shape to the team and a similar willingness to chance their arm with offloads out of contact.\n\nWhen it come off it looks great, when it doesn't it looks risky and messy.\n\nAre they moving too fast from the central tenets of the Warren Gatland and Shaun Edwards era? I'm not sure.\n\nItaly at home in the first game was a nice soft landing for a new coach, but it was disappointing not to be able to put Ireland under the same sort of pressure.\n\nIt is going to take some time to up-skill to an all-court game in attack and, defensively they have to be better than they were at the Aviva Stadium.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nWith new coaches, there is often the expectation that there is going to be some sort of immediate shift in style, despite the players being largely the same and the time it takes for any new philosophy to stick.\n\nFarrell is going about it the right way. There is not change for the sake of change, but instead a more gentle evolution.\n\nHe has made a few tweaks here and there - Jordan Larmour is now the definite first-choice full-back with Rob Kearney out the the picture, Andrew Conway is getting a go on the wing - but he is keeping the elements that made them the world's top side in 2018.\n\nHe is doing things his way, but not at the expense of the framework for success that predecessor Joe Schmidt laid down.\n\nTo put away a decent Wales side at home, and take the bonus point in doing so, was impressive.\n\nGrade: B+\n\nThe big call for Gregor Townsend so far in the Six Nations has come off the pitch - dealing with fly-half Finn Russell refusing to play for him.\n\nIt feels like a issue that has been a long time coming. You don't have a catastrophic breakdown in the relationship between your coach and star player over one evening or one breach of team rules. It must run far deeper and more fundamental than that.\n\nThe to-and-fro in the media has not been an edifying spectacle and, with two losses from two so far, Townsend desperately needs a victory.\n\nThis poor start to the Six Nations follows on from a dismal World Cup campaign and it is clear that they have gone backwards in the wake of Vern Cotter's departure.\n\nThey beat Ireland and Wales in Cotter's final Six Nations campaign in 2017.\n\nThey fought hard against England and Ireland, but they have made some basic mistakes, not least captain Stuart Hogg.\n\nThere are some bright spots for them. They have the makings of a good team. The pack is improved and Adam Hastings has done well filling in for Russell at fly-half, but I can't see where they will turn the corner.\n\nFrance have made some fantastic appointments behind the scenes, not least in recruiting defence coach Edwards from Wales.\n\nEngland could not deal with France's line speed in defence on the opening weekend in Paris and, while France were patchier in their win over Italy in the second round, Edwards will really galvanise that squad.\n\nHe has the sort of personality that will win over the players and give them direction and discipline in defence.\n\nI was at the Stade de France for their win over England and I have never known an atmosphere like it in Paris. Usually there is a hint of chaos in the crowd, but this time it did not feel like anyone was about to turn on the team or coaches.\n\nThat feel-good factor is strong and signs that is only going to get better. In Antoine Dupont and Romain Ntamack they seem to have found a generational half-back pairing, who will play together for the next decade or so.\n\nBehind them there is a very promising crop of youngsters, who have won successive under-20 world titles. Prop Demba Bamba leads a handful who look like they can lock down their national shirts for the foreseeable.\n\nGrade: B\n\nNew coach Franco Smith has tried to innovate. He has brought in a dual playmaker axis with Tommaso Allan and Carlo Canna at 10 and 12 respectively.\n\nGloucester back row Jake Polledri, one of the Premiership's strongest ball-carriers, is a gem and wing Matteo Minozzi is quick and dangerous.\n\nBut they are in transition. With number eight Sergio Parisse joining prop Martin Castrogiovanni in retirement at the end of the tournament, you can't see where their successors are coming from.\n\nTheir Six Nations games tend to fall into a rhythm of them conceding early - both Wales and France scored tries inside the first seven minutes of their matches - and Italy being unable to dig themselves out of trouble despite a few promising patches when the opposition's concentration wavers.\n\nIt is so hard trying to close the chasm in quality between them and the best northern hemisphere sides.\n\nGrade: D",

    "body": "Presenter Laura Whitmore has paid tribute to her \"vivacious\" and \"loving\" friend Caroline Flack, who was found dead in her London flat on Saturday.\n\nFighting back tears on her BBC Radio 5 Live show, she said the former Love Island host \"loved to love\".\n\nShe also appealed to listeners to \"be kind\" to others and said she wanted to use her platform to \"call people out\".\n\n\"To paparazzi and tabloids looking for a cheap sell, to trolls hiding behind a keyboard - enough,\" she said.\n\nA lawyer for Flack's family said on Saturday that she had taken her own life.\n\nThe 40-year-old had been \"under huge pressure\" since she was accused of assaulting her boyfriend Lewis Burton in December, her management company said.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress, these organisations may be able to help.\n\nWhitmore, who took over presenting Love Island following Flack's arrest, said her friend \"loved to laugh\" and had the \"most infectious chuckle\".\n\n\"I'm not going to pretend she was perfect, but is anyone? She lived every mistake publicly, under the scrutiny of the media.\n\n\"Caroline loved to love. That's all she wanted. Which is why a show like Love Island was important to her, because the show is about finding love, friendship, having a laugh. The problem wasn't the show. The show... is loving and caring and safe and protected.\n\n\"The problem is, the outside world is not. Anyone who has ever compared one woman against another on Twitter, knocked someone because of their appearance, invaded someone else's privacy, who have made mean, unnecessary comments on an online forum - they need to look at themselves,\" she said.\n\nWhitmore said had been debating whether she \"should, would or could come on air today\" but she wanted to talk about her friend \"to give her the respect she deserves\".\n\nShe said she had also been harassed for \"just doing her job\" and \"words affect people\".\n\n\"So to listeners - be kind. Only you are responsible for how you treat others and what you put out in the world,\" she said.\n\nShe then played Angels by Robbie Williams, saying her friend, who she met at V-festival about 10 years ago, loved music and loved to dance, and the song always reminded her of Flack because she \"danced so beautifully to it on Strictly\".\n\n\"Caroline, I'm so sad for you, for your family. I'm angry that you saw this as your only option as I know how much love and support you had. I'm sorry you didn't know that,\" she said just before she played the song.\n\n\"I am not sure when, but I know I'll see you on the dance floor again and I hope you are at peace and know that you are loved.\"\n\nFlack had co-hosted The X Factor and won Strictly Come Dancing in 2014, as well as presenting ITV's Love Island.\n\nShe stood down from the dating show after she was charged with assault in December. She denied the charges.\n\nFollowing her death, an ITV spokeswoman said she was a \"much-loved member of the Love Island team\".\n\nIn an emotional Instagram post, her boyfriend Lewis Burton said his \"heart is broken\" and promised the star he would \"be her voice\" and \"try to make her proud everyday\".\n\nBail conditions had stopped Flack having any contact with Burton ahead of her trial.\n\nHer management company have criticised the Crown Prosecution Service for refusing to drop charges, even though Burton said he didn't want the case to go ahead.\n\nThe CPS said it would not comment on the specifics of the case \"given the tragic circumstances\".\n\nFormer chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal said his impression was that the case had been determined to be a serious case, and one which the CPS felt they should proceed with \"regardless of what the victim thought\".\n\nHoney Lancaster-James, a TV psychologist who worked with celebrity contestants on an early series of Love Island, said it was important not to \"point the finger of blame\".\n\n\"There are often a number of factors, and a number of things that have led to a deterioration in mental health,\" she said.\n\nOther celebrities and ex-Love Island stars have also paid tribute to Flack, describing her death as \"heartbreaking\".\n\nHer co-presenter on The X Factor and The Xtra Factor, Olly Murs, said he \"always knew how fragile\" she was and his heart was \"forever broken\" because she was \"like a sister\" and they were \"friends for life\".\n\n\"This will hurt forever, love you cazza, Your Ols,\" he said.",

    "body": "\"I was really renowned. That was my bad luck.\" It was his bad luck because he had been talent-spotted by the Camorra - Naples' mafia clans.\n\nThe Camorra are completely different to the Hollywood stereotype of a single all-powerful family controlling an entire city or country.\n\nDr Felia Allum, of the University of Bath, has spent her career researching the clans - and their unique criminal alliances across Naples.\n\n\"In every district you would find a criminal family that controlled the territory,\" she says. But a family alone was weak. And so across Naples there are wider, shifting alliances.\n\n\"What those alliances tended to do, in order to be powerful and strong, was to recruit smaller clans.\n\n\"That's the flexibility and the fluidity of the Camorra.\"\n\nPanzuto's introduction to the Camorra came via an aunt who had married into the mob.\n\nHer husband, Rosario Piccirillo, headed one of the clans in his impoverished district and managed tax-free cigarette smuggling which made huge profits for his particular alliance in the city.\n\nBut Rosario wasn't a brilliant leader, and had few foot soldiers to do his bidding. He realised he needed to train an apprentice whom he could trust with his life, to help the clan survive.\n\nPanzuto was called home from Spain for what would become a life-changing meeting.\n\nHe met his Uncle Rosario at Mergelina Marina - a playground of the rich on the edge of the clan's territory.\n\nThere, Panzuto was introduced to a senior Camorra fixer - a man who solved problems for the alliance. This man had a proposal for the street thief. Rivals were planning to shoot Rosario in a growing tit-for-tat battle for control of that part of the city.\n\n\"Kill the person who wants to kill him,\" Panzuto was told. \"You have to do it because you're his family.\" Panzuto agreed to become a killer.\n\nAs he told me about his decision, he did so in such a matter-of-fact way that it didn't make any sense to me.\n\nDidn't he think it was wrong? He was being asked to become a murderer - and he didn't stop to say no?\n\n\"When you grow up in the world into which I was born, this [decision] was normal. I grew up with rules which meant that when I was bound to someone, I was also capable of murder.\"\n\nPanzuto kept to his promise to protect the family from enemies.\n\nThe first rival clansman he was told to target escaped with his life - but only because the police arrested him first.\n\nBut it wasn't long before he ambushed another Camorrista and shot him dead. It was his job, he says, and he got on with it without thinking too much about the enormity of his crimes.\n\nToday - after 12 years in prison - Panzuto insists he finally realises the horror of what he did. He's been through several periods of psychotherapy designed to make violent offenders take responsibility for their actions.\n\nHe says he's also put up walls inside his head to cope with his own inhumanity - but there are memories he can never escape.\n\n\"I don't remember the faces,\" he says. \"I remember the dull thud of the bodies falling after you've shot them.\n\n\"I remember the screams of the children, the women, ringing in my ears.\"\n\nOver the next decade, Panzuto came to play a leading role in both extortion, and shipping drugs on his home turf, La Torretta.\n\nAnd by 2005 Uncle Rosario was so up to his neck in police problems that the apprentice had to take over, to stop the clan collapsing.",

    "body": "A museum that was left work by the artist Edward Bawden has become \"the place to see\" his work.\n\nVictoria Partridge, from The Higgins Bedford, said being the custodian of about 3,000 of his pieces had helped bring a \"new audience\" to the town.\n\nThe latest exhibition showcasing his work has opened at the gallery and museum in Bedford town centre.\n\nEdward Bawden: Architectural Elements, features work that has never been on public display.\n\nMs Partridge, of the Higgins Bedford, said \"in the 1920s and 30s you could not move\" without seeing Bawden's work which included watercolours, print murals, illustrations for advertisements, crockery and even a garden bench.\n\n\"In his day he was very popular, his water colours and prints sold well and his commercial advertising work was unique, humorous and clever,\" she said.\n\nMs Partridge said the \"Bawden effect\" really kicked after some of his work was loaned to south London's Dulwich Picture Gallery in 2018.\n\n\"It meant a whole new audience found that we had his archive here,\" she said.\n\n\"Bawden fans know to come to us, so we get a lot of visiting art students. Bedford has become the place to see Bawden.\"\n\nBawden (1903-89) lived in Essex at Great Bardfield and Saffron Walden and was one of 30 people appointed as an Official War Artist by the War Artists' Advisory Committee during World War Two.\n\nHis work came to end up at The Higgins after he struck up a friendship with its then-head, Halina Graham, who was the curator when it was called the Cecil Higgins Art Gallery.\n\n\"He believed leaving it to somewhere where his work would be appreciated - next to the works of Turner and Picasso,\" said Ms Partridge.\n\n\"It would be in good company and not just put away in a larger museum for archive purposes.\"\n\nThe exhibition, featuring prints, advertising campaigns, private commissions, personal Christmas cards and wallpaper designs, runs until to 24 January 2021.",

    "body": "The UK government was not involved in talks with China over building the HS2 high-speed rail line, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said.\n\nChina's state railway company told HS2 Ltd it could build it in just five years and for less money, according to a letter seen by Building magazine.\n\nBut Mr Shapps told the BBC: \"This has not been a discussion with the Department [for Transport].\"\n\nIt comes after Boris Johnson this week approved the controversial HS2 scheme.\n\nThis was despite an official review warning costs could reach over \u00a3100bn, against a budget of \u00a362bn.\n\nWhen asked about the Chinese approach, Mr Shapps told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday: \"I've certainly had no advice on the subject. Obviously I will be asking to see what the communication has been.\"\n\nHe added: \"This has not been a discussion with the department, it's been a discussion with HS2 as I understand it.\"\n\nUnder current plans, the final stretch of the line is not due to be completed until 2040 - although Mr Johnson has said he wants that brought forward to 2035.\n\nHowever, Building magazine reported that the China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) had written to HS2 Ltd's chief executive last month, saying it could build the line by the middle of the decade, for a much reduced price tag.\n\nThe CRCC letter, also seen by the Financial Times, states: \"We are certain that we can offer a cost that is significantly lower than the projections we have seen.\n\n\"The advantages are, in our opinion, too great to dismiss on the basis that there are obstacles to overcome.\n\n\"You will find that the Chinese way is to seek solutions, not linger on obstacles and difficulties.\"\n\nHowever, British officials are said to be sceptical that it could operate in the same way in a democracy with property rights, protected landscapes and powerful lobbying groups.\n\nConservative MP Tom Tugendhat warned that letting CRCC build HS2 would be \"extremely questionable\".\n\nMr Tugendhat, who is chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said the UK was in \"dire need\" of a strategy around its relationship with China.\n\nMr Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday: \"Have we decided to take back control from Brussels only to hand it over to Beijing?\"\n\nCRCC has transformed China's transport system, building most of the country's 15,500-mile high-speed network.\n\nSupporters of HS2 say it will improve transport times, increase capacity, create jobs and rebalance the UK's economy.\n\nOnce it is built, journeys will be shorter. London to Birmingham travel times will be cut from one hour, 21 minutes to 52 minutes, according to the Department for Transport.\n\nAnd while it is being built, it is expected to create thousands of jobs and provide a stimulus to economic growth.",

    "body": "Having missed out on a world record in Glasgow on Saturday, Laura Muir will now throw herself into the pursuit of an even more illustrious target.\n\nMuir's time of 2.33.47 in the 1,000m at the Indoor Grand Prix in her home city was a season's best, but short of the 2.30.94 set by Maria Mutola in 1999.\n\nIt marked the end of the 26-year-old's indoor season, with her focus switching towards this summer's Tokyo Games.\n\n\"Ultimately I'd love to win an Olympic medal,\" Muir said.\n\n\"I feel like I'm at that sort of level now where it's achievable. That's what I'd love to take away from Tokyo, that would be amazing.\"\n\nRoared on by a passionate home support, Muir gave her all in trying to smash Mutola's 21-year mark, but accepts it was always a tall order.\n\n\"I think we were a bit slower going through 600m than I would have liked, but I was a couple of seconds off the record so I don't know if I would have been able to make that sort of time up,\" she said.\n\n\"It's always going to be so difficult, 1,000m is no room for any mistakes at all and even if you get it bang on, it can still be very difficult. I gave it the best shot I could and the support from the crowd was fantastic.\"\n\nMuir's training partner Jemma Reekie described her win in the 1,500m as a \"good confidence boost\". The Scot had to grit her teeth and come from behind on the final bend to outlast Ethiopia's Dawit Seyaum in a time of 4.04.07.\n\n\"It was a tough race,\" Reekie told BBC Scotland. \"I'm learning every day to be more patient, not panicking and just staying focused.\"\n\nThe victory ensured Reekie's recent impressive form continued, having this month set three new British indoor records, but she is trying to ignore the hype of her growing status within the sport.\n\n\"I'm not putting too much pressure on myself,\" she said. \"I don't really feel it off other people and I know everybody today wanted me to come out and win. I'm 21 years old and loving every minute of it.\n\n\"Laura (Muir) said to me last week you're going to have to get used to not slipping under the radar any more. I'm just going to enjoy it and really appreciate it. I'm just doing what I've loved even when I was nine years old.\"\n\nThere was another Scot on the medal podium in Glasgow, with Guy Learmonth taking third place in the 800m, running a season's best of 1.47.16.\n\n\"I feel in great shape and I wanted to go out and have a few solid races indoors,\" he said. \"The first 400 and 600m were still too slow but I finished strong and beat some great guys so I'm happy it's a big step in the right direction.\"\n\nFellow Scot Josh Kerr finished fourth in the same event, in a time of 1.47.40, a personal best for the America-based athlete.",

    "title": "Labour leadership: Nandy wins backing of leading Jewish group \" Heykayjones Blog",
    "body": "Lisa Nandy has won the backing of the Jewish Labour Movement in her bid for the Labour leadership after a heated campaign hustings.\n\nThe endorsement comes after an event on Thursday at which all four candidates apologised to Jewish members over the party's handling of anti-Semitism.\n\nThe Wigan MP said she was \"honoured\" to get the affiliate groups's official nomination.\n\nShe received 51% of members' votes, with Sir Keir Starmer second on 45%.\n\nShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey received 1.9% and 1.4% of members' votes respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Thornberry faces a battle to stay in the contest by securing her place on the members' ballot due to start next week.\n\nAhead of a midnight deadline on Friday, she still needs endorsements from a further three local party branches to qualify for the final stage.\n\nHer three leadership rivals have already guaranteed their places on the ballot through nominations from unions and affiliate groups.\n\nSir Keir, who is regarded as the frontrunner in the contest, received a further boost to his campaign by winning the backing of the TSSA transport union on Friday.\n\nThe Jewish Labour Movement, which has been a party affiliate since 1920, is one of the largest of such groups with the power to nominate leadership candidates.\n\nThe group's members can vote for whichever candidate they want when the final, one-member-one vote stage of the contest get underway next week. The result will be announced on 4 April.\n\nMany of the 20 socialist societies affiliated to Labour have balloted their members, with Sir Keir Starmer proving to be the most popular choice for leader.\n\nDuring the 90-minute hustings at a synagogue in north London, all four candidates were pressed on their record on, and ideas to tackle, anti-Semitism within the party.\n\nLabour's handling of the issue has dominated the tenure of outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is standing down following the party's defeat at December's election.\n\nAll candidates committed to implementing the recommendations of an ongoing inquiry into the issue from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).\n\nThe watchdog launched the probe into whether the party had \"unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish\" in May last year.\n\nAsked whether she had spoken with shadow cabinet members about anti-Semitism, Ms Long-Bailey said she had, but added: \"Was that enough? No it wasn't.\"\n\n\"Could I have done more? Yes.\"\n\nDuring a BBC Newsnight debate on Wednesday, Ms Thornberry accused Ms Long-Bailey of failing to push for tougher action on the issue within the shadow cabinet.\n\nMs Thornberry said that along with Sir Keir, she had called for \"regular reports\" on cases within the party but Ms Long-Bailey had not done the same.\n\nThe shadow business secretary rejected this, responding: \"I did, I think you'll find.\"\n\nAt the Jewish Labour Movement hustings, Mrs Long-Bailey said the party needed to put in place a \"legally independent\" process for handling complaints, and offer training to members on spotting \"insidious\" anti-Jewish conspiracy theories.\n\nMs Thornberry said the party was now dealing with the issue of anti-Semitism by kicking out members, but asked: \"Why on earth did we not do it two-and-a-half years ago?\"\n\nShe said as leader she would also be pressing for the Conservative Party to adopt a plan based on the EHRC inquiry, adding that the governing party \"have issues too\".\n\nSir Keir said getting to grips with the issue of anti-Semitism would require \"strong leadership,\" and would be a \"day one issue as far as I'm concerned\".\n\nLisa Nandy, who quit the shadow cabinet over Brexit in 2016, said anti-Semitism had become an \"existential\" issue for Labour and revealed she had previously considered her position within the party over the issue.\n\nMrs Long-Bailey took a swipe at her leadership rivals on Friday during a speech to set out a \"path to power\" for Labour following four election defeats.\n\nSpeaking in Salford, she said both Ms Thornberry and Ms Nandy had failed to set out blueprints for how Labour can win the next election.\n\nShe added that although Sir Keir was \"rigorous and detailed,\" the party's recent election defeat was \"partly to do with Brexit, and partly because too many voters thought we looked like just another bunch of politicians in Westminster\".",

Yeah be part of that healing stuff that happens with community.\"\n\nAnother concert-goer, bank worker Karen Adams, said: \"We're in Sydney so we couldn't even get down there to help, which was heartbreaking.
