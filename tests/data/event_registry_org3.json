    "body": "US Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren is being praised online for her fiery performance in a televised debate on Wednesday.\n\nBillionaire Michael Bloomberg was appearing in his first presidential debate in the contest and floundered in the face of rivals' attacks.\n\nMs Warren has fallen behind in the race but her attacks on Mr Bloomberg won her the debate on social media.\n\nBernie Sanders is currently the frontrunner to win the nomination.\n\nThe tone for the night was set when Ms Warren, a former teacher who has talked about her experiences of discrimination and unequal pay, branded Mr Bloomberg a \"billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians\".\n\nShe repeatedly attacked his record on women's rights, referring to private agreements he made to settle sexual harassment and hostile workplace lawsuits.\n\nShe continued her criticism in a tweet after the debate saying: \"I hope you heard what Mayor Bloomberg's defence of decades of mistreatment of women was: 'I've been nice to some women.'\"\n\nThe post was widely shared and #WarrenForTheWin was a top trend on Twitter on Thursday.\n\nMemes celebrated Ms Warren's \"take-down\" of Mr Bloomberg.\n\nAnother compared Ms Warren to the Harry Potter heroine Hermione Granger who routinely outsmarts her male friends.\n\nOthers focussed on the gender balance in the debate, saying that it was \"breath of fresh air\" watching a female candidate.\n\nMs Warren and Amy Klobuchar are the two female candidates in a field of 10.\n\nIn January, Ms Warren said her rival Bernie Sanders had told her a woman could not win this year's presidential election.\n\nBut Ms Warren wasn't the only candidate who struck a chord on social media.\n\nOthers commented on rivals Ms Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg's less-than-friendly exchanges.",

    "title": "Six Nations: How is England's Tom Curry fitting in at number eight?",
    "body": "Coverage: Live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra and online; text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. Live on ITV.\n\nThe spotlight would perhaps be less stark on Tom Curry in another year. Or another team.\n\nBut the 21-year-old is taking his first steps as a number eight on the international stage having played a starring role at flanker in England's run to the World Cup final.\n\nEngland head coach Eddie Jones decided against bringing in a specialist number eight to replace injured talisman Billy Vunipola, putting his faith instead in Curry making a rapid transition.\n\n\"I don't think it is a big change,\" Curry told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"I like to stay true to myself. Eddie's been good, the coaches have been good, the players have been good, so I'm excited to learn.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Curry faces arguably his biggest test yet when he comes up against an in-form Ireland side with CJ Stander, a British and Irish Lion in 2017, at the base of their scrum.\n\nSo what is Curry getting right and wrong in his new role?\n\nThe biggest difference between Curry and the man he is replacing - Vunipola - is the most obvious one.\n\nCurry weighs in at 15 stone eight pounds according to England's own stats.\n\nVunipola, just three centimetres taller, packs 19 stone 12 pounds onto his frame.\n\n\"Unless I'm putting on an extra 30kg I'll struggle to be Billy,\" Curry admitted. \"There are going to be slight differences between how we play defensively and attacking-wise at the breakdown.\"\n\nSo how much do England miss that heft? The signs were not good early in England's opening match against France.\n\nWith fewer than four minutes on the clock and the scoreline blank, England had forced France to retreat to their own five-metre line following a succession of big carries from Sam Underhill and Courtney Lawes.\n\nBut just when a charging Vunipola might have punctured the remaining French defence, Curry came up short.\n\nAdmittedly from a small sample of two rounds of the Six Nations, Curry is the least effective ball-carrier when compared with fellow number eights Gregory Alldritt, Stander and Taulupe Faletau, according to Opta's stats.\n\nBut Curry says in the absence of Vunipola, other back rows may share the ball-carrying load: \"It's a unit and we work as a team to fulfil what the back row does as a whole.\n\n\"It might not be that the eight does all the ball-carrying now, maybe the six has to do a bit more. We speak about it as a back row, we're very fluid about it. We all want to play to our strengths.\"\n\nAnd the signs are that Curry is eating up more ground as the competition goes on.\n\nAfter making just 10m from 14 carries against France, he managed 24m from 10 against Scotland.\n\n\"What really changes is at the base of the scrum,\" adds Curry.\n\n\"We're doing a lot of drilling during the week and contested scrums but it changes during the game. As a back row, it's all about working as a unit.\n\n\"Part of that is my ability I've had as a flanker, you're not going to take away from that. You've got to make sure I adapt in certain bits and add to that balance in the back row.\"\n\nCurry's naivety at the back of the scrum was exposed in the 11th minute of England's Six Nations opener in Paris.\n\nIn his usual position at flanker, Curry would have only a passing interest in the route the ball takes to the back of the scrum.\n\nHowever, at number eight, he was caught out as Jamie George hooked the ball through a channel between Charlie Ewels and Sam Underhill and England's forward-moving front row meant he had to react quickly.\n\nHe switched his position to the other side of Ewels, but it was too late...\n\n... the ball broke loose, Dupont pounced and a promising platform was lost.\n\nHowever, that part of his game was improved in tricky conditions in Scotland.\n\nAfter scrum-half Willi Heinz put the ball into a scrum in midfield in the first half, Curry was alive to the danger of the ball shooting out the back, adjusting his bind to get a better view of the situation.\n\nHe kept control as Scotland got a counter shove on....\n\n...and Heinz, in contrast to Youngs in Paris, had plenty of time to pick his option.\n\nHarlequins and England scrum-half Danny Care says Curry could be targeted by Ireland's number nine Conor Murray, another to have worn the British and Irish Lions shirt.\n\n\"As a scrum-half, you want to go up against an inexperienced number eight,\" said Care on the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.\n\n\"If your scrum gets parity, that's where the nuances of being a number eight might come unstuck against an experienced scrum-half like Murray.\n\n\"Positioning in the scrum, the way they keep the ball away from the scrum-half - if he gets that wrong, Murray is very experienced to be able to have a go.\n\n\"But Tom Curry is a wonderful rugby player, you could play him anywhere on the park and he would play well. He is doing an absolute job for England at the moment.\"\n\nIn last year's Six Nations, Curry led England's turnover tally, nabbing possession five times across the campaign.\n\nAlongside heavy-duty runners Vunipola and Mark Wilson in the back row, he was freed up to play the 'fetcher' role, sniffing out isolated opposition ball-carriers.\n\nHas that part of his game been restricted by his new number eight responsibilities? He says not.\n\n\"At eight you might find yourself in different positions but your ability to affect the breakdown, if it's there you're still going to do it,\" Curry explained.\n\nCertainly he has not matched the levels of Sunday's opposite number Stander.\n\nStander was shifted in the opposite direction to Curry, moving from eight to the flank, before an injury to Caelan Doris in the fourth minute of their win over Scotland on the opening weekend brought him back to the base of the scrum.\n\nHe has been as stubborn as a limpet at the breakdown since.\n\nIn the 66th minute of the win over Scotland, he clocked that Jonny Gray was taking the ball into contact without any substantial support.\n\nHe was over the top in an instant...\n\n...and would likely have had the turnover had referee Mathieu Raynal, spotting Iain Henderson failing to roll away, not awarded the penalty the other way instead.\n\nStander got his moment soon enough though.\n\nWith just two minutes left and Scotland hammering away metres from the Ireland line in search of a game-tying converted try, Stander first formed part of a three man gang-tackle to stop Jamie Ritchie and WP Nel's combined charge.\n\nHe then realised Scotland had shifted the point of attack with an offload to Hamish Watson and quickly moved on to the next task.\n\nHaving beaten team-mate Robbie Henshaw and Scotland replacement Ben Toolis to the ball, Stander's rock-solid, limbo-low body position survived a couple of clear-out attempts to secure a vital turnover.\n\nStander has a tournament-leading five turnovers, all from 'jackalling' over the top of the breakdown.\n\nWhile Curry's clever coverage of the backfield has helped him get closer to some isolated runners in the wide channels, he will probably have to go toe-to-toe in close quarters with Stander on Sunday.\n\nIf Jones had wanted something closer to a like-for-like replacement for Vunipola, he did have options.\n\nNathan Hughes was the back-up in the 2019 Six Nations but has since fallen out of favour while the hard-running dynamism of Saracens' Ben Earl has been used sparingly from the bench in this season's tournament.\n\nMeanwhile, Exeter's fleet-footed Sam Simmonds has been overlooked and Alex Dombrandt - the Premiership's player of the month for January after improving his output to eight tries from 16 matches this season - remains uncapped.\n\nCurry himself admitted he has needed Vunipola's help learning \"the nuances\" of the position, with the player he is filling in for \"picking up on things you don't get taught as a kid\".\n\nBut Jones seems to be taking Vunipola's absence as a chance to rebalance his back row, prioritising mobility and breakdown smarts over the ability to bust tackles and make clean breaks.\n\nHis metrics for measuring Curry's success as a number eight may be very different from those above.",

    "body": "A religious group in South Korea has been identified as a coronavirus hotbed, officials say, amid a sharp rise in confirmed cases in the country.\n\nIt is believed that the infections among members of the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony sect in the city of Daegu are linked to one woman.\n\nThe sect accounts for 30 of 53 new cases, with officials warning of an unprecedented crisis in the country.\n\nSouth Korea also confirmed its first death from the virus, named covid-19.\n\nThe coronavirus, which originated in China's Hubei province, causes pneumonia-like symptoms.\n\nChina has now seen 2,118 deaths and recorded nearly 75,000 infections.\n\nOn Thursday, Japan said two of its passengers who contracted the coronavirus on board quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess had died. The man and the woman were in their 80s.\n\nSouth Korean health officials believe that the infections are linked to a 61-year-old woman who tested positive for the virus earlier this week.\n\nThe Korean Centre for Disease Control says the woman - who has not been identified - had contact with 166 people, who were asked to self-quarantine.\n\nAt least 30 of the new Covid-19 infections were on Thursday recorded among sect members in Daegu, a city of about 2.5 million people in the south-east.\n\nThe Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, which has been accused of being a cult, said it had now shut down its Daegu branch and that services in other regions would be held online or individually at home.\n\nThe mayor of the city has described the event as an \"unprecedented crisis\" and urged people in the city to stay indoors.\n\nThe overall number of confirmed cases now stands at 104.\n\nNew cases were also reported in the capital Seoul and the nearby North Gyeongsang province.\n\nMeanwhile, the authorities revealed that a man died on Wednesday from pneumonia believed to have been caused by the coronavirus.\n\nThe 63-year-old man - who has not been publicly named - died in hospital in the south-eastern city of Cheongdo.\n\nHe and several other patients had earlier tested positive for the virus.\n\nThe victim had been bedridden for more than 20 years at the hospital, Yonhap's news agency reports.\n\nThe ocean liner was carrying 3,700 people in total and passengers who tested negative for the virus began leaving the ship on Wednesday after a 14-day quarantine.\n\nHundreds have now disembarked from the cruise liner docked in Yokohama. Others are set to leave over the next two days.\n\nMore than 150 Australian passengers have already arrived in Darwin, where they will begin two weeks of quarantine.\n\nThe first batch of people from Hong Kong have also flown back to the city, where they will similarly be quarantined.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Britons stranded on the ship would be able to board an evacuation flight home on Friday, as long as they were not showing symptoms of the virus.\n\nIndonesia is also set to repatriate its citizens.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nChina reported 114 new deaths on Wednesday but the number of new infections recorded was 394 compared with 1,749 on Tuesday.\n\nThere are more than 1,000 cases outside China, including on Diamond Princess and in Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong.\n\nIran says two people infected with the virus have died in the city of Qom - the first reported deaths in the Middle East.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hong Kong said a 70-year-old man with underlying illnesses had become the territory's second fatality.\n\nJapan has three deaths attributed to the virus, while France, the Philippines and Taiwan have each reported one death.",

Six police officers were also in court.\n\nAt the High Court in Glasgow, Dr Gordon Skilling, from the State Hospital, told prosecutor Lisa Gillespie that MacDonald had a dissocial personality disorder.\n\nHe said: \"He has perpetrated a series of violent crimes involving carrying and using weapons, including improvised weapons, He will have little regard or remorse for his actions.\"\n\nThe court was told MacDonald suffered from persecutional delusions and did not accept that he had a mental illness.\n\nDr Skilling added: \"He exhibits violent behaviour. There was a recent violent incident within the State Hospital and he would exhibit violence to the public at large.\"\n\nMs Gillespie asked Dr Skilling: \"How high is that risk,\" and he replied: \"I would say it is very high.\"\n\nRobbie Christie, a guard at HMP Grampian in August 2017, said MacDonald had only been there a few days when he launched an attack on prison officers.\n\nHe said MacDonald, who was armed with a broken radio aerial and a sharpened toilet brush handle, slashed and stabbed at him and two colleagues.\n\nMr Christie said: \"Every time I was hit, it was puncturing my body. The incident was a big blur. The blood was in my eyes.\n\n\"I have never been back to the prison since. I have been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. At the time, I had been an officer for 15 years.\"\n\nLady Stacey ruled that MacDonald carried out 11 of the charges.\n\nHe was acquitted of trying to kill one prison officer and seriously assaulting another at Perth jail.\n\nLady Stacey ordered him to be detained at the State Hospital under a compulsion and restriction order.\n\nHe will only be freed when he is no longer deemed a risk.",

I abhor racism and bigotry of any shade. My character and my politics are republican and egalitarian,\" she said.\n\nMr Shatter, who is Jewish and was a Fine Gael minister between 2011 and 2014, claimed the comments from Ms Cronin were not off-the-cuff, but rather conformed \"to a particular pattern\".\n\n\"She has generally made a series of completely inappropriate and egregious anti-Semitic tweets,\" he said, speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\nMr Shatter said the removal of the tweets from the Twitter account of Ms Cronin prevented \"full scrutiny\".\n\nAlso speaking on the programme, Sinn F\u00e9in TD for Dublin Fingal Louise O'Reilly, said it was her understanding many of the highlighted tweets were made before she had become a member of Sinn F\u00e9in.\n\n\"She has apologised unreservedly. Absolutely, totally, and completely,\" said Ms O'Reilly.\n\nSpeaking on RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland programme on Thursday, Sinn F\u00e9in TD Pearse Doherty said he had not seen the tweets, but that their contents was \"inappropriate\" and \"not in keeping with Sinn F\u00e9in's policy\".\n\nHe said some of the tweets had been made before Ms Cronin was a member of Sinn F\u00e9in, and a number of others were from before she was an elected representative.\n\n\"She has withdrawn them, she has apologised, and she has apologised for any hurt which has been caused,\" he said.\n\nAsked if it was investigating the Ms Cronin's tweets, garda\u00ed said the force did not comment on named individuals.",

For the past few months, swarms of desert locusts have been eating their way across the Middle East and Africa. As Joe Inwood finds, stopping the swarms has so far proved nigh on impossible for people in the region - with many resorting to yelling, blowing whistles or even firing guns at them.\n\nItaly's anti-mafia police do their best to catch the big shots in clans like the Camorra. Dominic Casciani spent an evening with battle-hardened officers in unmarked patrol cars tackling organised crime in Naples.\n\nIn the southern Russian city of Rostov on Don, Anastasia Shevchenko is facing six years in prison for political activism. Several human rights groups have declared the activist a prisoner of conscience and now the Russian authorities have eased the conditions of her detention in her small flat. Sarah Rainsford witnessed Anastasia's first taste of freedom.\n\nLast October President Trump abruptly withdrew US forces from North East Syria, abandoning the Kurds, who had been a key American ally in the defeat of so-called Islamic State. Turkey took advantage of the power vacuum by launching an air and ground offensive to occupy Kurdish territory. An estimated 300,000 people were forced to flee their homes.

The one who is damaged by this is Leganes.\"\n\nAccording to his official website, Braithwaite \"showed a natural flair for the game\" as a baby and describes himself as the \"fastest player in Denmark\".\n\nRaised in the Danish town of Esbjerg, for whom he began his youth career, he made his senior debut in 2009 and helped the club to the Danish first division title in 2011-12 and cup in 2013.\n\nDespite that success, the striker hinted at feeling undervalued during his time at Esbjerg.\n\n\"They may not have known what I could do, but I knew,\" he said.\n\nDeparting Denmark for Ligue 1 side Toulouse in 2013, Braithwaite made 137 appearances before joining Championship side Middlesbrough in 2017 on a four-year contract.\n\nInitially signed by manager Garry Monk, the forward struggled for opportunities under his replacement Tony Pulis. \"Disagreements\" between the pair ensued, leading to loan moves to Bordeaux and then Leganes.\n\nHe made his Leganes move permanent in the 2019 summer transfer window.",

    "title": "Apology demanded for 'Tinker Experiment'",
    "body": "A formal apology has been demanded for a years-long social experiment to \"settle\" Scottish gypsy travellers.\n\nThreatened with having their children removed from them and taken into care, families were forced to leave their lives on the road for settlements.\n\nKnown as the \"Tinker Experiment\", the operation ran from the 1940s to 1980s and was supported by UK governments and Scottish local authorities at the time.\n\nBrother and sister Shamus and Roseanna McPhee are campaigning for an apology.\n\nThey grew up on former Bobbin Mill site in Pitlochry, living in a prefabricated World War Two-style Nissen hut which had no electricity, a coal fire for heating and candles for lighting. The site was later regenerated and the huts replaced with wooden chalet accommodation.\n\nSimilar sites were established in Aberdeenshire, Argyll, Highlands, Perthshire, Fife and the Borders.\n\nBut the McPhees argue that the experiment left lasting physiological damage and gypsy travellers continued to face discrimination and other challenges.\n\nThe Scottish government said it had sought to tackle problems affecting the community.\n\nWorking with local authorities' body Cosla, the Scottish government recently announced a \u00a33m action plan aimed at supporting improvements to accommodation, education, healthcare and access to benefits.\n\nEqualities Minister Christina McKelvie also said she and fellow MSPs had heard \"distressing testimonies\" from families about how they were affected by the Tinker Experiment.\n\nGypsy travellers were threatened with having their children taken from them and were were settled on sites across Scotland, including Muir of Ord and Wick in the Highlands.\n\nThis effort to \"assimilate\" gypsy travellers into Scottish society, an idea first suggested in 1917 for what was seen by authorities as a problematic community, began in the 1940s and continued until the 1980s.\n\nThe McPhees were among families settled during that time.\n\nMs McPhee said: \"We had one bedroom for nine of us. The living room had a coal fire and that was the only heating.\n\n\"Lighting was a Tilly lamp and candles in the bedroom.\"\n\nShe said there was asbestos, a harmful and now illegal construction material, in the hut's wall panels. When the asbestos was later removed, she was at home studying for her school exams when workmen took it out.\n\nMs McPhee said the authorities must have known the significance of what they were doing. She said: \"It was an experimentation without your knowledge and without your consent.\"\n\nThe McPhees said the Tinker Experiment saw families deliberately housed in poor accommodation.\n\n\"There was a belief at the time that gypsy travellers were unable to keep a house clean or in order,\" Ms McPhee said.\n\n\"So the policy was to put them in sub-standard accommodation and they would become 'accustomed' to keeping a house and they would then get a 'normal' house.\n\n\"I have an account from the Scotland Office at the time which makes it very clear that they were using the children - threatening to remove the children from travelling families if they didn't take up the offer of accommodation.\"\n\nMs McPhee said the experiment left long-lasting effects.\n\nShe said: \"Many have mental health problems, and I would say that the most significant impact has been that those who were in the experiments are mistrustful of those in the wider community, and I think that is a real shame.\"\n\nThe McPhees, along with other campaigners, want a formal public apology for the past treatment of gypsy travellers in a similar way as apologies made to gay men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal and people affected by a contaminated blood scandal.\n\nMr McPhee said: \"I do welcome the fact other groups have been granted apologies as a form of redress, but we have never had that.\"\n\nHe said that even though Scotland's gypsy travellers were now legally recognised as an ethnic group they still faced discrimination and were expected to \"resign themselves to being at the bottom of the pecking order\".\n\nMr McPhee said his family and others were taking a stand, no longer prepared to stay silent on how they had been treated.\n\nChristina McKelvie said the Tinker Experiment had been a \"distressing\" experience for families.\n\nShe said: \"The Scottish government accepts that lives of many gypsy travellers have been blighted by historical policies and practices of councils and charities, and we absolutely recognise the devastating and lasting impact this had on families.\"\n\nThe minister said it was \"time to turn words to action\", adding: \"We must now focus on working together across political, organisational and geographical boundaries to deliver the actions that are so desperately needed, to address the inequality and injustice that this community continues to face.\"",

My heart and gut just sway to Wilder's punch power. I think that knockout shot will land on Fury.\n\nCarl Froch: I'd say Fury on points. I do not like the talk of him knocking Wilder out. He would have to stand in range and to do that you can get clipped on the chin. If you do with Wilder it's lights out. I think Fury's talk of taking Wilder on at his own game is a smokescreen.\n\nSugar Ray Leonard: I know that Fury has excellent boxing abilities and a tremendous chin from the way that he got up from the two knockdowns in their previous fight. In the end, I think that Wilder is always in shape and that he will use his speed and power to get the job done.\n\nManny Pacquiao: Never bet against a puncher, particularly one like Wilder. I look at him like I do at a Mike Tyson, another puncher. I see Wilder winning this rematch by 10th-round knockout.\n\nAnthony Joshua told Pep Talk UK: I hope Fury wins. I think the man that nearly did it the first time won't get it wrong the second time. He came so close, to the point of a draw, so I think Fury will come back and win.\n\nLarry Holmes: Wilder will knock out Fury in the seventh or eighth round if he does what I know that he can do, which is stay on the outside, use his jab and throw that right hand over the jab.\n\nPaulie Malignaggi: I feel like it's going to be Fury on points, but it's a fight between the two best fighters in the weight class. I do think Fury has to be careful with getting careless in spots, but Wilder can't just fight believing he can land one shot and get him out of there.\n\nCarl Frampton: Wilder can win by knockout at any moment but push me and I'd say Fury on points.\n\nEvander Holyfield: I'm picking Wilder based on his confidence and the fact he does all of the right things to remain in great shape, and that he's committed to his craft. Wilder's not just a big guy with a right hand, he's also become more calculated in his approach.\n\nShawn Porter: I have not had this hard of a time picking a winner of a fight after dissecting every component in a very long time. It's razor thin until the end. I'm picking Wilder to win by KO, Fury by points, or Fury by KO. This is a 50-50, I'm picking the fans to win.",

    "title": "England Women v Ireland Women: Zoe Harrison 'wants more' despite sell-out",
    "body": "Coverage: Listen on the BBC Sport website; live text commentary on the BBC Sport website & app.\n\nEngland have sold out Doncaster's Castle Park for the first time for Sunday's Women's Six Nations game against Ireland, but Red Roses back Zoe Harrison says the side \"want more\".\n\nThe record attendance for an England Women ticketed home game outside a World Cup is 10,545 - but Castle Park's capacity is barely half that at 5,007.\n\nHarrison, 21, hopes bigger venues are on the horizon for the team.\n\n\"Our goal is to sell out Twickenham,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's massive that we are selling out stadiums now. We're so happy but we want more. The game is growing so we want to sell out bigger stadiums and push it further.\n\n\"I would like to explore some of the [men's] Premiership teams' stadiums and start getting round the country.\"\n\nSunday's game will be the third time England Women have played at Castle Park as they continue their Grand Slam defence against the only other unbeaten team in the tournament.\n\nA crowd of 10,545 watched the Red Roses beat Italy at Exeter's Sandy Park in the 2019 Six Nations and the Rugby Football Union's head of women's performance Nicky Ponsford says the latest sell-out crowd is \"really exciting\".\n\n\"We've been close to selling out Doncaster before but we haven't actually done it,\" Ponsford said on the RFU website.\n\n\"What this does show is how far the game is moving on, that people want to come and see us play and there's nothing better than playing in stadiums that are sold out.\"",

    "body": "Northampton Saints have signed Ospreys lock Ben Glynn on a short-term loan deal to cover a second-row crisis.\n\nFollowing injuries to David Ribbans and Alex Moon, and Courtney Lawes on Six Nations duty with England, Saints are now without four locks following Api Ratuniyarawa's four-week suspension.\n\nThey have turned to 6ft 6in former Bristol and Harlequins man Glynn, 28, who can also play in the back row.\n\n\"He offers an immediate option in a position of need,\" said Chris Boyd.\n\nThe Saints director of rugby added: \"Injuries and international availability throughout the Six Nations period is obviously putting a little strain on the depth of our squad.\n\n\"We've got to get over that challenge and Ben will help us to do that. In the very short time he has been with the squad, he has slotted in brilliantly. So, despite a bit of a whirlwind week, he will certainly be in contention for selection against Exeter this weekend.\"\n\nCheltenham-born Glynn, who represented England at Under-18 level, has been with Ospreys since signing from Harlequins in October.\n\nHe made 40 appearances in two years with Quins, who he joined in 2017 after seven years at Bristol.\n\nNorthampton are second in the Premiership table going into Sunday's match against leaders Exeter at Sandy Park, although a bonus-point win for Sale at home to Leicester on Friday would drop Saints to third.",

    "body": "People are being warned to \"stay away from the base of cliffs\" in Cornwall after recent rock falls.\n\nThere have been a number of falls on Newquay's Great Western Beach caused in part by stormy weather and heavy rain.\n\nCouncillor Joanna Kenny said members of the public can be \"quite foolish\" when choosing to walk underneath fragile cliffs.\n\nRock falls have also been reported in West Bay, Dorset, and Watcombe Beach near Torquay, Devon.\n\nThere are concerns about building developments close to parts of the Newquay coast with the Environment Agency (EA) projecting the cliffs to recede by seven metres in the next 100 years.\n\nThe EA said rock falls \"appear to be on the increase\" due to climate change.\n\nMrs Kenny, who has helped develop a plan for restricting future developments near cliff tops at Newquay, said: \"Members of the public can be quite foolish.\n\n\"When we had a big rock fall we went down to inspect it and people were coming along and sunbathing, leaning back against the rocks that had come down, and we told them 'you do realise these things come down without warning and you are straight underneath it'.\"\n\nCornwall Council advised people to \"act sensibly when visiting the area and to stay away from the base of the cliffs when walking on the beach\", adding: \"Cliff falls and erosion are natural processes and part of this changing landscape.\"",
