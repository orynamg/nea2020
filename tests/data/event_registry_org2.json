    "body": "Derby County player Max Lowe has said he is \"shocked\" by comments from pundit Craig Ramage on BBC Radio Derby that suggested \"young black lads\" should \"go back to basics, working hard\".\n\nEx-Rams midfielder Ramage was speaking on the Sportscene Podcast after their 1-1 draw with Huddersfield Town.\n\nLowe, 22, posted on social media calling out \"racial ignorance, stereotyping and intolerance\".\n\nThe BBC said the comments were \"entirely unacceptable\".\n\nFormer England Under-21 international Lowe said he had decided to \"speak out on behalf of black players at Derby County\", including fellow full-back Jayden Bogle, 19, whose recent performances, along with Lowe's, came in for criticism by Ramage.\n\nDuring the broadcast, Ramage, who the BBC confirmed would no longer work with the corporation, said: \"When I look at certain players, their body language, their stance, the way they act, you just feel, hold on a minute, he needs pulling down a peg or two.\n\n\"So I'd probably say that about all the young black lads, all the young advice if they wanted it, that, you know, it's about, when you are struggling for form, you are going through a sticky patch, it's about going back to basics, working hard, and doing the right things.\"\n\nFollowing the podcast's publication, Lowe posted a statement on Instagram that said: \"As a young black footballer making my way in the game, I was shocked by comments made by one of the analysts on BBC Radio Derby's Sportscene programme after our 1-1 draw with Huddersfield.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Racial ignorance, stereotyping and intolerance negatively affects the image of impressionable young footballers and creates an unnecessary divide in society.\n\n\"I am also disappointed that a public service broadcaster did not step in to ask the analyst to explain his reasoning or to distance themselves from these archaic thoughts.\n\n\"This was a broadcast at the same time BBC Derby is promoting a 27-minute feature with former Rams defender Charlie Palmer about the difficulties he faced as a young black footballer in the 1980s.\"\n\nHe added that \"as a professional footballer at an ambitious, high-profile Championship club I know that my performances will be scrutinised and I have no problem with that whatsoever - but I do not think it is acceptable for myself and my team-mate Jayden Bogle to be judged by the colour of our skin\".\n\nDerby County FC said it was \"aware of comments made by a BBC employee after yesterday's game against Huddersfield Town, directed specifically at a section of our young players\".\n\nThe club added: \"We have been in contact with the BBC throughout the day and underline that we do not in any way condone any form of discrimination.\n\n\"We take comments like these extremely seriously, we do not tolerate them, and stand shoulder to shoulder, together as one with all our players.\"\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"These were entirely unacceptable comments and we will no longer be working with Craig.\"",

He didn't mean it. That is new to me.\n\n\"I don't like talking about officials especially after a defeat because you can look like the violin is out or you are looking for excuses but when I think the timing is right, I must say I was disappointed in them today.\n\n\"People will probably look at highlights and think Rangers rode their luck because they hit the post but if we had good and the right officials today, that would have been a 3-0 win, if we score the penalty.\n\n\"I am not sure you would back us to do that right now but we could have been out of sight and a lot more comfortable if the officiating had been better.\n\n\"It is nothing to do with how I feel or where we are. I just think at this level you expect decisions like that to be right and that is all I ask.\"\n\nMidfielder Halliday was injured in the 66th minute after falling over an advertising board and hitting a chair.\n\nAnd Gerrard praised the 28-year-old for continuing, despite receiving stitches.\n\n\"He's gone over the advertising boards and nearly lost his eye, because the chair has gone into just above the eye,\" said the Rangers manager.\n\n\"He's had stitches and carried on so I'm really pleased with his bravery and character to carry on.\"",

    "body": "Even by the standards of his remarkable year, it has been quite a few days for Glamorgan's Australia batsman Marnus Labuschagne.\n\nFirst he was compared to legend Sachin Tendulkar by the Indian batsman himself before being named the Australian Test player of the year ahead of Steve Smith.\n\nLabuschagne was a concussion substitute for Smith during the second Ashes Test in Lord's in August 2019 where he scored 59 to help salvage a draw.\n\nHe was named in the ICC's 2019 Test Team of the Year after scoring the most runs in the calendar year with 1,104 in 17 innings at an average of just under 65.\n\nThis included three centuries against Pakistan and New Zealand before an international best of 215 against the Black Caps in Sydney in January 2020.\n\n\"I am lucky to have so many great players in the Australia team to learn off and when you look at people like Steve Smith, someone like that has set the bar so high,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"This award was pretty amazing to receive. As a team we had a great year and to finish the summer as the Australia Test player of the year was special and I am very honoured.\n\n\"The way the team has played over the last six months has been terrific, retaining the Ashes and then beating New Zealand and Pakistan in five Tests at home.\n\n\"You look at the likes of David Warner, Steve, our fast bowlers and Nathan Lyon who have all been tremendous with the pressure we can apply daily.\n\n\"It's a privilege to play with these guys and I will continue to learn as much as I can.\"\n\nLabuschagne was also given special praise by India legend Tendulkar, who holds the Test record of 15,921 runs in 200 matches.\n\nTendulkar said he knew Labuschagne was special within 15 minutes of watching him and likened the Australian to his own style.\n\n\"I was honoured hearing those words from Sachin,\" said Labuschagne.\n\n\"It was amazing to hear somebody of that calibre say something like that about me. It is making sure you take that on board but also stay grounded.\n\n\"Cricket is a fickle game. At the moment things are looking good and it's about keeping that feeling.\"\n\nAfter making his mark in Test cricket, Labuschagne scored 100 runs in his first two one-day international innings and hopes to become a regular across all three formats for Australia.\n\nHe also says he is indebted to Glamorgan's role in his rise after joining them in 2019.\n\nThe 25-year-old scored 1,114 county championship runs in 10 matches before winning back his international place against England at Lord's.\n\n\"Glamorgan have played a massive part in my last 12 months,\" said Labuschagne.\n\n\"The way (coach) Matt Maynard spoke about the game resonates with me and I love talking to him about cricket. I learned so much in my time there and put a lot of things into practice.\n\n\"Scoring runs was always something I wanted to do for Glamorgan and they gave me the opportunity to do that.\n\n\"Then came the chance to play in the Ashes and it has all developed from there.\"\n\nLabuschagne has signed for Glamorgan for two more seasons but his presence will be limited after the opening two months of the British summer because of his international success and desire to play all three formats.\n\nAustralia have a two Test tour of Bangladesh in June, one-day and T20 internationals in England between July 3 and 16, and three one-day internationals at home to Zimbabwe in August,\n\n\"I can't say the exact amount because it is all depending on selections,\" said Labuschagne.\n\n\"I know I am available for the first six championship games or the opening two months and then Australia have a tour to Bangladesh.\n\n\"There are some one-dayers directly after the Bangladesh tour in England before a bit more of a break where I will be able to play a few more games with Glamorgan. Then we will have to wait and see to see how the rest of it pans out.\n\n\"I just have to make sure when I am there I am enjoying it with the playing and coaching staff. I love playing in Wales and it's why I have signed for the next two seasons.\n\n\"It will be nice to get back to Glamorgan this season and a change in conditions. I can rug up with my jumpers and have hand warmers in my pockets.\n\n\"I just want to keep playing as many games as I can and that's the way to keep on top of my game and have some momentum. There will be times you have to have rest at some points but I just love playing.\"",

    "body": "In 2011, Scott Young took on a challenge that perplexed many of his peers. He would attempt to complete an MIT computer science degree without enrolling in the elite Boston-based university, using free materials that MIT posted online. Young built a curriculum using recorded classes, did the necessary assignments and exams mirroring the constraints and conditions (to the extent possible) that MIT students were subject to. He graded everything himself, using the solutions and marking schedule that MIT made available. In the end, he 'completed' the equivalent of what an MIT degree might look like without paying any tuition fees. His only expenses were the required textbooks.\n\nYoung already held a bachelor's degree in business, as he explained in his 2012 TEDx Talk. But several years into his career, he knew he wanted to study computer science. Yet he didn't want to commit to a four-year degree; if a degree was like eating a five-course meal, he wanted his education 'a la carte'.\n\nYoung's approach to education might be an anomaly, and it's important to note that he undertook the project out of curiosity rather than as a training mechanism for a programming career; he did not obtain an 'official' MIT degree. Yet as the cost of a university education continues to balloon, many wonder whether the return on the investment is worth it and if there might be alternative paths to job success.",

    "body": "Porto forward Moussa Marega walked off mid-way through his side's win at Vitoria Guimaraes, saying he was subjected to racist abuse from fans.\n\nMarega, 28, started to walk towards the dugouts in the 69th minute, nine minutes after scoring what would prove the winner in Porto's 2-1 victory.\n\nHe pointed his thumbs down and also raised his middle fingers to the crowd.\n\nTeam-mates and opposition players tried to persuade him to stay on, but he was eventually substituted.\n\n\"We are a family regardless of nationality, skin colour, hair colour,\" said Porto boss Sergio Conceicao. \"We are human, we deserve respect. What happened here is unfortunate.\n\n\"We are completely indignant about what happened. I know the passion that exists for Vitoria and I think most of the fans do not see themselves in the same attitude of some people who have insulted Moussa since the warm-up.\"\n\nFC Porto's match report on their website described it as \"a sad situation that should make the Guimaraes club and Portuguese football blush with shame\".\n\nTeam-mates including Alex Telles, Sergio Oliveira and Ivan Marcano all tried to stop Marega walking off the pitch, grabbing the Malian player around the waist - but he pushed everyone aside on his way to the tunnel.\n\nMarega spent a season on loan at Vitoria in the 2016-17 campaign, scoring 15 goals in 25 games.",
