    "body": "Forty Americans being taken off the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess are infected with new coronavirus, a US official says.\n\nThey are among 400 people from the US leaving the vessel docked in Japan.\n\nMost are due to depart for the US on two government-chartered aircraft. But those carrying the virus will be admitted to Japanese hospitals.\n\nMeanwhile, China has tightened restrictions on movement in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak.\n\nThe Diamond Princess has been quarantined in Japan's port of Yokohama with some 3,400 people on board since 3 February after a man left the ship in Hong Kong and was found to have the virus.\n\nIt has the largest cluster of coronavirus cases outside China. The Japanese authorities on Sunday said the number of new cases on board the ship had risen by 70 to 355.\n\nThe 40 Americans who are infected will receive medical treatment in Japan, Dr Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told Face the Nation on CBS.\n\n\"Others are going to be evacuated, starting imminently, to Air Force bases in the United States,\" he said.\n\n\"If people on the plane start to develop symptoms, they'll be segregated within the plane.\"\n\nThose entering the US will undergo a 14-day quarantine, he added.\n\n\"And the reason for that is that the degree of transmissibility, on that cruise ship, is essentially akin to being in a hotspot.\"\n\nOther evacuation flights will repatriate residents of Israel, Hong Kong and Canada on the ship.\n\nPeople in the province of 60 million have been ordered to stay at home, though they will be allowed to leave in an emergency. In addition, a single person from each household will be allowed to leave the building every three days to buy food and essential items.\n\nOn housing estates, one entrance will be kept open. It will be guarded to ensure that only residents can enter or leave.\n\nAll other businesses will stay closed, except chemists, hotels, food shops and medical services.\n\nThere will be a ban on the use of private cars, but vehicles used for the delivery of essential goods are exempt.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities in the capital, Beijing, have ordered everyone returning to the city to go into quarantine for 14 days or risk punishment.\n\nChina's central bank will also disinfect and store used banknotes before recirculating them in a bid to stop the virus spreading.\n\nOn Sunday, the Chinese authorities reported 2,009 new cases - down from 2,641 on Saturday, and 5,090 the day before.\n\nNew cases spiked earlier in the week after a change in the way they were counted but have been falling ever since. In total, more than 68,500 people have so far been infected in China.\n\nNational Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said the figures showed China was managing to curb the outbreak.\n\n\"The effects of epidemic prevention and control in various parts of the country can already be seen.\"\n\nThe commission's daily bulletin also reported 142 more deaths nationwide, the vast majority in Hubei.\n\nHowever Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that along with a drop in infections within Hubei there had been a rapid increase in the number of people who had recovered.\n\nThe proportion of infected patients considered to be in a \"serious condition\" has dropped nationwide from more than 15% to just over 7%, according to China's State Council.\n\nTaiwan has now reported a death from the illness - a taxi driver, 61, who had not travelled abroad recently but had diabetes and hepatitis B, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said.\n\nThe minister said many of his passengers had come from China.\n\nOutside China, there have been more than 500 cases in nearly 30 countries. Four others have died outside China - in France, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan.\n\nMeanwhile, a plane carrying 175 evacuated Nepalis, mostly students, has arrived in Kathmandu from Wuhan. It is the latest country to fly its citizens out of Hubei province.\n\nThe virus is a new strain of coronavirus and causes an acute respiratory disease which has been named Covid-19.",

It'll be a case of calling the landlord and calling the insurers and see what happens after that.\n\n\"For us, it's a case of the unknown at this stage.\"\n\nBBC News NI reporter Richard Morgan, who went to the scene, said the incident appeared to have happened without warning.\n\n\"One woman, I've been speaking to, said she walked along here just seconds before, and got into her car. She was visibly shaken and says she had a lucky escape.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Republic of Ireland's weather service, Met \u00c9ireann, has issued an orange wind warning for nine counties.\n\nThe warning covers Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Sligo, Clare, Cork, Kerry and Limerick and will remain in place until 22:00 local time on Sunday.\n\nStorm Dennis descended on the UK on Saturday, bringing a month's worth of rainfall to some of the worst-hit areas.\n\nThe Army was deployed to help with flood relief in some areas with severe disruption to road, rail and air travel.\n\nOn Sunday major incidents were declared in south Wales and parts of England, as Storm Dennis continues to batter the UK.\n\nDyfed Powys Police said a man had been found dead after falling into the River Tawe, while South Wales Police said it was dealing with \"multiple\" landslides and floods - some trapping residents.\n\nDisruption has been much less severe in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland has said that multi-agency partners stand ready to respond to disruption and instances of flooding.\n\nIn Londonderry, high-sided vehicles are barred from using the Foyle Bridge while all other vehicles must keep to a 30mph maximum speed limit.\n\nRoad users have been advised to check the latest traffic information on the Trafficwatch website.\n\nIf you are affected by flooding, then it can be reported to the flooding incident line on 0300 2000 100. You can also check information on flooding in your area via the NI Direct website.\n\nStorm Dennis was the fourth locally-named storm of the winter season after Storm Atiyah in December, Storm Brendan last month and Storm Ciara earlier in February.",

His female passenger, also 25, and the male Golf driver had minor injuries.\n\nWest Yorkshire Police said the traffic officers were conducting static speed enforcement checks on the road, which has a 40mph limit and is known locally as a hotspot for speeding.\n\nThe force said the incident had been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which attended the scene on Saturday evening.\n\nThe officers were not in pursuit of the vehicle at the time of the crash and ran on foot to the scene to give first aid, the force added.",
