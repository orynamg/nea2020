                "body": "MEDFORD -- What a difference four years have made in the life of Lenape High School senior Samantha Coon.\n\nOnce a quiet and timid girl who socialized little in her freshman year, today she is a senior with confidence who has improved her academics, communication skills, ability to work with and help others and her soccer skills, which landed her the starting spot as the varsity girls team goalie this year.\n\nShe also has risen to a leadership position as the Army cadet battalion commander of the school's 101 students in its Junior Reserved Officer's Training Corps (JROTC) -- an achievement she never envisioned when she joined that program as a freshman.\n\nFor academic excellence, JROTC achievements, athletics and other endeavors, Coon has received the Bronze Cross for Achievement from the Legion of Valor, an organization of military heroes who have been awarded one of the two highest military honors a serviceman can receive -- the Medal of Honor or Distinguished Service Cross.\n\nOf the 14,000 JROTC high school and college ROTC cadets nominated internationally for this honor, she was among less than 75 chosen worldwide. The award is the second highest a cadet can received in JROTC.\n\n\"The chances of getting it were very low because there were so many applicants, so I did not expect it. It's an honor to receive such a high award and it has boosted my confidence even further,\" the 17-year-old said before leading her rifle drill team practice.\n\nRetired Army lieutenant colonel Ron Tuczak, her lead JROTC instructor, said he believes she may be the first Lenape cadet ever to receive that award.\n\nShe credits the character-building JROTC program and its instructors with her development into a more mature, outgoing and responsible student and leader.\n\n\"For me, it made me develop personality-wise and otherwise. The instructors are always there for us and everyone is supportive of one another and works together as a team,\" Coon said.\n\n\"I was quiet and kept to myself and had little confidence when I came to high school, but this training boosted my self-esteem and I opened up and took on challenges like the drill team.\n\nShe joined JROTC because she comes from a military family.\n\n\"This is what I grew up with. My whole life was, military, military, military. That's what I know.\"\n\nHer plan is to attend Widener College to major in criminal justice and to eventually become a military policeman like her mother and possibly make the Army a career after entering the service post-college as a second lieutenant.\n\nHer father is a retired Army captain who was in charge of a Patriot missile battalion while her older brother is a boatswains mate on a Coast Guard cutter.\n\nCoon also credits the JROTC program and its instructors with her development into a more mature, outgoing and responsible student and leader.\n\n\"Her instructors are great mentors and have set her up for success by steering her to improve in the program,\" said her mother, Heather Fasnacht, who served eight years in the Army.\n\n\"I am extemely proud of her and her accomplishments. She puts so much effort into the JROTC program and is well-deserving of it (the Legion of Valor Bronze Cross).\"\n\nSchool officials said Coon epitomizes both Lenape Indian Battalion's motto, \"Our Standard is Excellence,\" and the most desirable traits for all cadets and leaders.\n\n\"Samantha is a scholar candidate who displays these characteristics on a daily basis -- loyalty, initiative and integrity to name a few -- and deserves every bit of this award recognition,\" Tuczak said.\n\nSchool Principal Anthony Cattani praised her dedication and conscientiousness.\n\n\"She possesses an infectious intellectual curiosity and demonstrates exceptional leadership in all that she does,\" he added.\n\nTuckzak said as a direct result of demonstrated leadership and initiative, Coon was selected above more experienced cadets to serve first as a platoon sergeant and later was promoted to battalion commander.\n\nHe said she set herself apart from her peers by volunteering to lead the armed drill team's inspection events several years ago and now also heads its athletic endurance teams called the Raiders.\n\n\"Not only did she execute her duties faithfully, she played a pivotal role in the Lenape High School Army JROTC earning recognition as South Jersey Drill Team Champions and personally led her inspection platoon, both armed and unarmed, to multiple first place trophies.\n\nHe said the battalion has consistently performed well since then, earning 11 first place finishes through last year in drill team inspection events.\n\n\"This unprecedented achievement allowed the Indian Battalion Drill Team to win the South Jersey League Championship for two consecutive years and the right to compete at the National level for the first time in its 24-year history,\" he wrote in her nomination letter.\n\nCoon's drill team again finished in first place at the Jan. 11 competition among nine high schools and held at Central Regional High School in Bayville while the battalion finished second overall in event categories.\n\nHe also said he appreciates Coon's \"spunkiness\" and \"quick wit.\"\n\nTuzak said JROTC is more than military training because it also focuses on diversity, the U.S. Constitution, first aid, personal trait improvement and careers in the service branches.\n\nAt a recent drill team practice with her troops, who carry disabled Springfield rifles, Coon orders were as clear and commanding as active duty Army drill sergeants give.\n\n\"Present arms!\" the leader of the rifle drill team shouted, followed by other orders like \"Order arms!\" and \"March!\" as the cadets responded in unison. Afterward she checked foot and row alignments while inspecting the red hoodie sweatshirt-clad cadets.\n\nSophomore cadet Isabella Borden called the battalion commander a \"strong leader\" who is looked up to while cadet Julia Backus said Coon is \"always motivated, which has a domino effect on all the cadets.\"\n\nCadet Sgt. Major Robert Hamilton described Coon as very professional, well respected, welcoming to cadets coming into the program and relating to them well.\n\nRecently, Coon led a formal familiarization briefing for Col. Frederick J. Toti, the new 2nd Brigade Commander of the U.S. Army Cadet Command in Fort Dix, who called her a \"leader of character who will go far in whatever path she chooses in life.\"\n\n\"She is an impressive young lady who gave an outstanding presentation and overview of the Lenape JROTC program. Her leadership is quite evident and is exemplified in this high performing program which has multiple awards and trophies.\"\n\nCarol Comegno loves telling stories about South Jersey history and our military veterans. Her book, \"The Battleship USS New Jersey: From Birth to Berth\" is the definitive history of the battleship. If you have a story to share, call her at 856-486-2473 or email ccomegno@gannettnj.com.",

                "body": "Ahead of the release of his Disco Raja, actor Ravi Teja talks about the film, his family, life lessons and other interests.\n\nOne watches Ravi Teja's films not for the setup, plotline or treatment, but for the sheer joy of watching a phenomenon in action. And going by the teaser of his forthcoming film, Disco Raja, which hits the screens on January 24, it's a phenomenal fun ride awaiting his fans.\n\nAs we enter his suite room in a private studio in the city on a Saturday morning, we Ravi Teja engrossed in the day's newspaper.\n\nWhen he sees us entering the room, he folds his paper and says with a smile, \"I am just catching up with filmy updates. I don't know anything other than cinema, and I don't want to know either. But that's how I've been all my life.\"\n\nThen, handshakes and pleasantries done with, we settle down a fun talkfest.\n\nBut we can't help but begin with the start of Disco Raja's teaser. In it, the actor can be seen walking in through rooms in slow mo. And as he throws away an apron off him, a background voice says, \"I am done with this f@&king crap.\"\n\nSo, is that a caution to filmmakers not to approach him with mediocre scripts, we ask with a chuckle.\n\n\"Exactly,\" he replies. \"From here on, I want to do something different, and Disco Raja is a film with interesting content. I thoroughly enjoyed working for the film and whenever I enjoy the process, trust me, I am certain the audience would enjoy it too.\"\n\nThe one teacher he relies on\n\nAudiences and their cheers aside, Ravi Teja is one who has been constantly learning from his past failures.\n\nThen telling us how they never dampened his spirit, he adds, \"Nothing teaches you better than failure. I mean... come on, why should failures affect me? I'll fight and move on. Yes, initially, failures affected me, but soon, I learnt not to take anything seriously as long as people around me took me seriously.\"\n\nFor a rank outsider like him, 21 years of film journey (as a lead actor) has helped discover everything about cinema. Ask him how he reflects on his journey, and he replies, \"I don't want to look back, but simultaneously, I don't think about the future too. But all in all, I just want to go with the flow.\"\n\nDisco Raja is a sci-fi thriller, which showcases life in a typical retro set up. \"Since I grew up in that era, I could immediately connect to the script when Vi Anand narrated,\" he explains.\n\nMoving to the rhythm\n\nDisco Raja has been in the news for Ravi Teja playing the dual role of father and son, in which one of his characters suffers from a syndrome, etc.\n\n\"That's what I want; to let people be curious about my film,\" he says, adding that he's happy for the buzz that has picked up.\n\nBut not many know that Ravi Teja is a fitness freak, and his lean look is part of his routine.\n\n\"I have been very disciplined right from the start of my career,\" elaborates the Raja The Great star, \"But the discipline levels have now gone up a few years ago, and I started feeling very good and happy.\" Ravi Teja ascribes to everything staying illuminated in his life to staying away from negativity. And while he believes that his attitude of not to expect anything from others keeps him blissful, Ravi Teja believes that workout, family and shooting keeps his happy. \"I don't even party; I am like that,\" he maintains, \"I am happy to sit at home during leisure, watching films on Netflix and Amazon .\n\nHis biggest critique\n\nHis son, Mahadhan, who studies in the 8th grade, had made a brief appearance in one of his earlier films. Does the actor have plans to groom his son? But Ravi tells us that he will let his son be what he wants to be. \"Mahadhan always watches my films. In fact, he is my biggest critic; he's brutally honest and witty too. My wife Kalyani too gives her opinion on my films.\"\n\nSo what kind of a father is he, we are curious. \"I am always friendly. My son and daughter treat me like their friends. And on my part, I too behave like a married bachelor,\" he laughs as he signs off.",

It's not about rice,\" says the aerobics and functional fitness trainer who once lost 12 kgs through diet and a fitness course at Slimmers club.\n\nThe chairperson of the fitness chapter of All Ladies League, Tamil Nadu who has trained hundreds of women in Chennai goes back to her early days and talks about her career.\n\n\"I trained under Stina, TT Vasu's wife. She sent me to London and Sweden for training in aerobics and after I finished my training in London, I started taking classes at Arogya in Vasu's place in 1985.\"\n\nAlmost 10 years later, in 1994, Suraiya started her own fitness centre called Suraiya Awareness Center and 7 years later she found herself joined by Nina Reddy of O2 health studio and then went on to be part of several fitness groups in the following years.\n\nThe fitness enthusiast, who has been ruling the roost in the fitness space, recalls her childhood. Kuchipudi exponent Vedantham Raghaviah's daughter used to be drawn towards dance.\n\n\"I was very fond of dancing, but I started out with Yoga in 1979. After a short stay in Bangalore for two years, I came back to Chennai in 1980 and soon after crossed path with Stina Vasu. It motivated me seeing so many women going through such amazing transformation. And music coupled with exercise is always fun.\"\n\nTalking about fitness scene in the city, Suraiya says, \"it has caught on really well over the last 25 years. I feel Chennai has come a long way.\"\n\n\"The fact that I have survived in the industry for so many years speaks volumes,\" Suraiya says as she bursts into laughter, adding, \"I guess I have trained almost every woman in Chennai. People come to me, saying I trained them almost 40 years back.\"\n\nThe organisation, which will conduct a walk in Anna University on March 8, in view of International Women's Day, has been holding 'wake up and walk' every day, as a lead-up to the main event.\n\n\"The ongoing one is open to all and people join in as we walk. Last week we walked in the Boat club, this week we are doing Marina, the following weeks will cover Besant Nagar Beach, Eco Park etc. The aim is to bring awareness.\"",

I don't think that's miles, miles away maybe as it was some years ago,\" Djokovic of the NextGen winning a Major title. \"I think they are definitely hungry. They're challenging. They're knocking on the door.\"\n\nThe clash between old and new will be epitomised in the first round on Monday, when Venus Williams, who turns 40 this year, plays 15-year-old rising star Coco Gauff - who wasn't even born when her fellow American lifted her first Grand Slam trophies in 2000.\n\nJapan's Naomi Osaka, 22, is defending a title for the second Grand Slam in a row after her repeat bid at last year's US Open fell flat in the fourth round.\n\nWorld number one Ashleigh Barty, fresh from winning the Adelaide International on Saturday, carries Australian hopes of seeing the first home-grown women's winner since 1978.\n\n\"Obviously it's the perfect preparation. But regardless of whether I won the title or not last week, I feel like I'm well-prepared,\" Barty said.\n\n\"I'm happy, I'm healthy. I'm coming into the first Grand Slam of the year with a smile on my face. That's all I can ask of myself.\"\n\nThe tournament is taking place against the backdrop of a bushfires emergency that has swept the nation and ramped up fears over global warming - and billowed choking smog across Melbourne and other cities.\n\nAfter player anger during qualifying and practice, when several were hit by coughing fits and breathing problems, air pollution returned to 'moderate' levels over the weekend, with rain forecast for the start of the tournament.",

                "body": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will soon divide their time between the United Kingdom and North America as they embark on their new lives as non-working members of the British royal family.\n\nSpeaking of the transition, Harry and Meghan said: \"This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter\".\n\nWith the details of how that will work detailed in a statement on Saturday, it's clear Harry and Meghan are breaking new ground in the British monarchy.\n\nPerhaps their lives might resemble that of Princess Madeleine of Sweden, who divides her time between the United States and Sweden with her young family in tow.\n\nMadeleine, 37, is the youngest child of Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and his wife Queen Silvia.\n\nHer sister Crown Princess Victoria is heir to the throne. Princess Madeleine's brother is Prince Carl Philip, who is married to Princess Sofia.\n\nMadeleine moved from her home country to New York in 2010, after calling off her engagement to Jonas Bergstrom amid allegations he was unfaithful.\n\nShe fled Sweden to escape the media attention and settled in the Big Apple, where she continued to work for the World Childhood Foundation, which she had been involved with since 2006. The charity was started by her mother in 1999 and helps to aid children who are abandoned, abused or neglected, providing vital resources, mentor programs and legal services to children globally. Princess Madeleine is now on its board of directors.\n\nIt was in New York where Madeleine met British-born banker Christopher O'Neill, who was living in Manhattan. They were introduced by friends and soon after announced their engagement.\n\nPrincess Madeleine married O'Neill on June 8, 2013. The couple returned to Sweden for the wedding, which took place at Slottskyrkan, the chapel at the Royal Palace in Stockholm.\n\nThe wedding was attended by British and European royalty, including the Earl and Countess of Wessex, Crown Princess Mary and Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and Princess Charlene of Monaco.\n\nMarrying into the Swedish royal family came at a cost to O'Neill, who previously had no experience with such matters.\n\nSpeaking for the first time about being married to a princess, O'Neill told Swedish magazine King in 2018: \"I've met the woman of my life, the woman I love. But it is clear that it has its challenging sides to be married to a princess. Of course, it has complicated my life, for obvious reasons.\n\n\"I have no desire to achieve any kind of fame, nor have any benefits of it in my professional life. It happens that I'm mad about Madeleine. But in the end, you learn to live with it.\"\n\nWhen he and Madeleine married, O'Neill chose to decline a royal title and Swedish citizenship, preferring to keep his dual American-British citizenship.\n\nHe also chose not to receive a royal title because he wanted to live as a private citizen.\n\nDuring O'Neill's interview, he also addressed accusations his wife doesn't work in the traditional sense: \"It happens that I read in the media and react to insinuations that she does not really work as Princess of Sweden, and I get upset on her behalf.\n\n\"She sometimes chooses not to use her princess title in what she does, which means that much of her work can happen behind the scenes, which in turn means that the press rarely draws attention to it. And why should they? She has made an effort just to avoid it.\"\n\nIn fact, Madeleine chose not to use her royal title when she co-authored a book, released in early 2019.\n\nThe situation was a little different for Norway's Princess Martha Louise, who was banned from using her royal title for business purposes.\n\nRather than using her royal fame to help sell the book, Madeleine opted for the more discreet Madeleine Bernadotte (her middle name) on the cover.\n\nThe book - Stella and the Secret - deals with the subject of child sexual abuse, a subject Madeleine admits isn't an easy one to talk about.\n\n\"We wanted to reach out to the children directly, directly to the home where we know that everything starts, both good things, but unfortunately also bad things,\" Madeleine told Swedish magazine Mama in 2019.\n\n\"I think it is tremendously important that the children understand and respect bodily integrity, and that you don't touch people on certain parts of the body - you respect the private areas.\"\n\nProceeds of the book go directly to Madeleine's charity.\n\nAs a mum-of-three, Madeleine knows the importance of raising children in a protective environment.\n\nThe family currently lives in Miami, having moved there in August, 2018. Previously they lived in New York - where Princess Leonore, five, was born - then London and back to Stockholm, where Prince Nicholas, four, and Princess Adrienne, one, were delivered.\n\nMadeleine, who grew up in Drottningholm Palace in Stockholm, says her children don't yet know they are royalty.\n\n\"I haven't actually spoken with them about that yet,\" Madeleine told Mama.\n\n\"I think it will come about quite naturally. And I think that that's what it was like for me too, because I can't remember that my mother and father sat us down and told us, rather, it came naturally.\n\n\"I think that when the time comes they will ask questions and wonder, and that's when it will have to be addressed, but for now they can live in their little bubble, in their little world without titles.\"\n\nMuch like Prince Harry and Meghan's desire to raise Archie away from the fishbowl that is the monarchy, Madeleine and O'Neill want their children to have normal lives.\n\nIn October, King Carl XVI Gustaf revoked the royal status of five of his grandchildren, stripping them of the titles of 'royal highness' and freeing them from royal duties.\n\nThe decision affects Madeleine's children and those of Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia, Princes Alexander and Prince Gabriel.\n\nCrown Princess Victoria's children with husband Prince Daniel - Princess Estelle, seven, and Prince Oscar, three - are unaffected.\n\nThe king said the move was done to \"clarify expectations\".\n\n\"It will hopefully be helpful when my grandchildren eventually carve out their own future. But, to that day, it is far away,\" King Carl Gustaf said.\n\nThe children are no longer entitled to the taxpayer-funded 'appanage' or allowance that is given to members of the royal house.\n\nPrincess Madeleine agrees with the move, saying it said it would give her children \"a greater opportunity to shape their own lives\".\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan's decision to not give Archie a title is believed to be for similar reasons.\n\n\"A HRH title does put an extra burden on the child,\" Juliet Rieden told 9Honey's The Windsors podcast.\n\n\"And I think Harry will feel that very keenly, he has talked about how difficult it is being part of the royal family and the expectations that come with a title, and of the freedom that not being known as a prince would give.\"\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan's move to North America is also expected to afford them and their son an element of privacy they don't have in the UK.\n\nThat's something Princess Madeleine knows all too well. The media leaves her children alone when they are in Florida, but the situation is very different in her homeland.\n\n\"In the US, they are also left more alone compared to when in Sweden,\" Princess Madeleine said.\n\n\"In Florida they aren't recognised as often. I think that Swedes are very respectful with the children, it's rare that anyone comes up.\n\n\"Even if we're in the park and I see that people have recognised us, nobody comes forward to take a picture of the children or anything.\"",

                "body": "Meghan Markle will soon be happily laughing all the way to the bank.\n\nDump Archie's bottles. The only bottle worth milking right now is all the commercial\/public appearance deals coming to Meghan Markle, who quite frankly lost her sparkle amongst the British commoners for being so forthright and bold.\n\nMeticulously calculating her every micro move since she got back from Canada, where she and Harry with their little Archie spent Xmas, Megs decided to go directly to the Canada House, the Greek Revival building on Trafalgar Square in London, on her return. There, she and Harry met the Canadian High commissioner Janice Charette before throwing egg on the monarch and the British public by declaring that the couple have decided to step back from their royal duties.\n\nLike, hello? Did anyone get the memo of this news information? Everyone believes no one did. Not even the Queen Mother or Prince Charles! It was only minutes before their declaration that they even made the news worldwide via their official Instagram page.\n\nCome to think of it, this whole move was supposed to be a 'construct', having been designed as swiftly as Elton John's private jet-which they use frequently for their jaunts across the globe. Ten months, that's how long it took them to make such a bold and feisty decision.\n\nSure, it isn't easy to handle as much criticism for being a multi-cultural first lady of the world. But it would be totally delusional of Megs to think she wouldn't receive this level of colour discrimination especially in the one place in the world, which still prides on being 'white'.\n\nIn Britain, however tourist-friendly they are, a large part of the 'princely' country is still orthodox on such matters despite all the other controversies they've had to deal with owing to the royal family's ...ahem!... colourful lives.\n\nThe harried little prince\n\nWhat's more, Prince Harry, no matter if he takes up 'odd' jobs to fit into the role of being financially able, will always be known as the sixth to the thrown of the most prestigious and rich royal family in the world.\n\nThe one whom he now leaves behind the spotlight to will be the Duchess of the Sussex, who is essentially our Megs.\n\nShe definitely knows what's up. She knows that Prince Harry, however, wild he was in the past-often caught doing the most notorious activities, including wearing a Nazi uniform to a fancy dress party-has a very soft heart and is still affected by the death of his late mother, Princess of Wales, Princess Diana,the people's Princess.\n\nOver an interview during their last South African tour, Prince Harry also addressed the matters of his heart, saying, \"Every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back.\" He meant the painful memory of his mother's death.\n\nAlso, Harry's relationship with older brother William went south after Wills told him that he and Megs were headed too fast in a relationship and that he should take time to marry the lady of his dreams. Harry began distancing himself from his closest confidante.\n\nWhen an interviewer asked him about his current relationship status with Wills, Harry answered, \"Inevitably stuff happens. We're certainly on different paths at the moment, but I'll always be there for him.\"\n\nMajestic freedom\n\nAll that being said, the one who has finally broken from the usual Brit stiff upper lip has not only found voice but also a voiceover deal with Disney to benefit the wildlife conservation charity, Elephants without Borders, a whopping voiceover deal, at that -- during her South Africa visit. In her interview, Megs was near tears, telling the interviewer that what she was going through was something very real. \"Thanks for asking because not many have,\" did she say?\n\nNow, Meghan will not only be happy but also be soon happily laughing all the way to the bank. Going by her smarts and not-only good looks, she is going to use her royal status and her ex-Suits star trump card as much as she can,to be earning in billions. (Hey! Why stop at millions, right?) However, poor Harry might be relegated to playing the role of her \"manager\", juggling between managing to bring up the baby in a Brit\/American manner and playing spot-boy to Megs as she jingles before the lens to ring in more moolah.\n\nAnd so what if Princess Megs won't be the queen of the monarch? So long as she gets to be the queen of the celluloid and earn much more money than her rival sis-in-law, Megs is all set to reign. May we say, her worries are gone with the Wind(sor)!",

                "title": "Netanyahu aides fume at Edelstein for announcing immunity panel vote",
                "body": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein seen at a state ceremony at the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem as Israel marks the annual Holocaust Remembrance Day, April 12, 2018. (Noam Moskowitz\/POOL)\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reportedly fuming on Sunday over Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein's announcement that a vote will be held next week on forming the committee that will weigh the premier's request for parliamentary immunity.\n\n\"It's sad to see how Edelstein fell into the trap laid by the left. With his own hands he is allowing the Knesset to became a political circus during elections by lending a hand to the tricks of the left, which is trying to use the Knesset to neutralize Netanyahu,\" read a statement attributed to associates of the prime minister.\n\nNetanyahu's son Yair went on record to attack the Likud Knesset speaker, tweeting and later deleting, \"His wife's father is Leonid Nevzlin, an oligarch who is wanted for murder in Russia, and the owner of Haaretz newspaper.\"\n\nNevzlin was found guilty, in absentia, on several counts of conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to life behind bars. In 2014, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of Nevzlin, a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing Moscow of carrying out a \"a ruthless campaign to destroy [him] and to expropriate [his] assets.\"\n\nThe opposition Blue and White party lauded Edelstein's decision and criticized the prime minister for seeking to pressure the Knesset speaker.\n\n\"Netanyahu is applying all possible pressure to prevent the deliberation on the immunity request, but despite the delay efforts, the immunity debates will start next week, [they] will be conducted in a fair and matter-of-fact manner and conclude before the elections,\" the party said in a statement.\n\n\"Netanyahu requested a debate on immunity -- Netanyahu will get [a debate]. We'll prevent an extremist immunity coalition from continuing to drag down Israel solely for the personal interests of Netanyahu,\" Blue and White chairman Benny Gantz tweeted.\n\nEdelstein, in a statement earlier Sunday, explained his decision to convene the plenum for a vote on forming a panel to debate Netanyahu's immunity request.\n\n\"Even though I disagree with the position of the Knesset legal adviser, I believe that, in order to maintain trust in the institution of Knesset speaker by all the factions, it is important to accept it,\" he said.\n\nEdelstein was referring to a legal opinion issued last week by Knesset legal adviser Eyal Yinon that said a House Committee -- the panel required to debate Netanyahu's request -- can be convened despite the Knesset being in recess ahead of the March 2 election.\n\nWhile green-lighting the formation of the plenum, the Knesset speaker did not mask his disgust for the topic at hand, calling the effort to vote on Netanyahu's immunity request \"invalid\" and \"constituting contempt of the legislature.\"\n\nHe said the vote will not be held this week as Jerusalem welcomes leaders from around the world to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The earliest day on which the vote can be held will be next Tuesday, with Monday being International Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nThe House Committee is widely expected to reject Netanyahu's request for immunity from prosecution in the three criminal cases against him.\n\nEdelstein has been under pressure from Netanyahu's political rivals to hold a vote on forming the House Committee in the wake of the Knesset legal adviser's ruling allowing it to convene.\n\nThe Knesset speaker, who said he disagreed with Yinon's legal opinion but would abide by it, was also facing pressure from Netanyahu and his allies to block the plenum from voting on forming the committee.\n\nLikud lawmakers claimed that Yinon should not have been allowed to issue his ruling due to a \"serious conflict of interest\" stemming from the fact that his wife, Amit Merari, is part of the team of prosecutors who worked on the prime minister's criminal cases.\n\nWhile acknowledging the conflict of interest, Yinon said Thursday in response to a High Court of Justice petition filed by Likud MK Miki Zohar that his opinion on forming a House Committee -- a procedural question -- had no bearing on the actual cases against Netanyahu or the expected immunity proceedings in the Knesset.\n\nOn Friday, Blue and White MK Avi Nissenkorn called on Yinon to intervene over Edelstein's failure to move forward on a request by Knesset members to review Netanyahu's immunity request.\n\nNoting adviser Yinon's legal opinion, Nissenkorn said Edelstein had failed to call the plenum to vote on forming the committee, despite appeals by a majority of MKs that he do so.\n\nBlue and White has reportedly threatened to oust Edelstein if he fails to convene the plenum by early next week.\n\nMembers of the Knesset Arrangements Committee voted Monday 16 to five in favor of establishing and staffing the key committee. But a vote on the establishment of the committee must also take place in the Knesset plenary open to all 120 MKs, a majority of whom, crucially including the right-wing Yisrael Beytenu party, have already declared that they support establishing the committee.\n\nYinon ruled last week that Edelstein does not have the right to prevent the Knesset plenum from forming the House Committee, which is usually not convened in a transitional government.\n\nOnce formed, the House Committee is likely to debate and potentially vote on Netanyahu's immunity request in the coming weeks, perhaps even days, long before election day.\n\nThe prime minister and his supporters have argued that the committee should not be formed because the Israeli government is in transition, and also because there is insufficient time before the elections for it to properly weigh the immunity requests.\n\nNetanyahu's immunity request, and his subsequent efforts to prevent the forming of the House Committee to debate it, were widely perceived as an effort to stall for time ahead of the March elections, because Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit cannot open trial proceedings against him before it is brought to a vote.",

                "title": "Sikh diaspora calls for Rwanda-style tribunal for 1984 anti-Sikh riots - Times of India",
                "body": "LONDON: The Sikh Federation UK (SFUK), an UK NGO, is joining forces with around 200 Sikh representatives from more than 20 countries to lobby the UN Security Council (UNSC) for a \"Rwanda-style\" international tribunal to investigate crimes during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.\n\nIn 1995, the UNSC established the \"International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)\" to prosecute those responsible for genocide and other violations of international humanitarian law committed in Rwanda in 1994, which led to 93 indictments.\n\nLast week, the Narendra Modi-led NDA government accepted the findings of the Supreme Court-appointed Justice SN Dhingra Committee -- the latest of the 10 such other panels -- which was scathing of the then Rajiv Gandhi government, judiciary, and Delhi Police, accusing them of not investigating anti-Sikh violence, while charging some police officers of conspiring with the perpetrators.\n\nBhai Amrik Singh, chair of SFUK, said: \"Our experiences from the last 35 years and this latest report shows the police, politicians, and judiciary in India are corrupt to the core and the wheels of justice hardly turn. It is therefore impossible to secure justice within the Indian system. We are confident in securing the support of the majority of the five members of the UN Security Council. It is the entire Indian machinery that must be put on trial in an international arena.\"\n\nRami Ranger, chairman of the British Sikh Association, said he supports the initiative.\n\nThe SFUK is launching its new \"collective platform\" in Paris at the end of March and says it will allow for international co-ordination of a range of political activities around a shared global agenda.\n\nLord Singh, a British Sikh peer, said: \"There should be a criminal investigation into 1984, there is no doubt. Many of us have been pressing for it for years. The Indian authorities aren't doing it.\"\n\nBut he said he could not see the UNSC entertaining it. \"Britain, America, and Russia have all economic interests in India. It needs an independent inquiry. Britain would support a refusal to consider it. The UN can set it up but big global players should not be involved.\"\n\nHe said, ideally, the India government should commission an independent inquiry.\n\n\"The Modi government can't be blamed for 1984 but they could and should have launched an independent inquiry more on the lines of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (assembled in South Africa after apartheid) as to lessons learned and if there is criminal behaviour and people are still about, they should be punished.\n\n\"The Justice Dhingra Committee report has not done that. It needs clout. It has drawn attention to failings and abuse in a kind of academic way, but it is not enough. A proper inquiry should go further and look to punishment and lessons learned. The punishment is not as important as to the cause and how it started because there is a feeling in the Sikh community that it started at the very top of the government and there is evidence of that and that has not been clarified. I don't know why the present government can't pin the blame on those responsible from Rajiv Gandhi downwards. That is what makes it a genocide -- the deliberate, planned extermination of a people of a certain religion -- and that has not been investigated.\"\n\nPreet Gill, British Sikh MP, told TOI: \"I welcome the BJP accepting the findings of the Special Investigation Team (SIT). We have seen many investigations take place, so I commend the BJP for pushing this. Union minister Prakash Javadekar has called 1984 (anti-Sikh riots) a genocide and it must be recognised as such,\" she said, referring to the comments of Javadekar where he said: \"What happened in 1984 was not just riots but the worst kind of genocide against the Sikhs\".",

                "body": "Comes as some dating apps found to have been leaking personal information\n\nMore than 70,000 photos of Tinder users have been stolen and shared by a cyber-crime website, it has been reported.\n\nThe criminals only stole photographs and data from female accounts and it is feared that the images could be used to set up fake profiles for catfishing scams.\n\nThe photos were discovered by cybersecurity firm White Ops and were accompanied by a text file containing about 16,000 unique Tinder user IDs, according to Gizmodo.\n\nMore than 70,000 photos of Tinder users have been stolen and shared by a cyber-crime website, it has been reported (file image)\n\nIt is unclear exactly what the images will be used for but it could be to target and harass the users themselves or to generate fake user profiles on other platforms.\n\nAaron DeVera, a researcher at the cybersecurity firm White Ops, said they discovered the images on a website known for trading in malicious software.\n\nIt is also possible that the information could also be used to train a facial recognition product.\n\nA Tinder official told Gizmodo that the use of any photos or information outside the confines of the app is strictly prohibited.\n\nThe company said it will take whatever steps it could to have the data removed offline.\n\nDeVera said that he is particular disturbed by the fact that whoever amassed the profile data is 'very openly targeting female-presenting users.'\n\nAaron DeVera, a researcher at the cybersecurity firm White Ops, said they discovered the images on a website known for trading in malicious software (file image)\n\nHe added: 'Dumps of data such as this typically attract fraudsters, who use it for making large collections of convincing fake accounts on other platforms.\n\n'Stalkers might use this in a more targeted manner, in an effort to add to a collection of data to use against an individual. Long-term concerns is that these pictures could be used for fraud and privacy violations.'\n\nHe also implied that 'raunchy' images could be among those leaked, saying: 'Given the context of this being a dating app, there are photos a person may not necessarily want presented to the public.'\n\nIt comes as some dating apps were found to have been leaking personal information to advertising tech companies in a possible violation of European data privacy laws.\n\nThis was revealed by a report from The Norwegian Consumer Council on Tuesday.\n\nThe council, a government-funded nonprofit group, commissioned cybersecurity company Mnemonic to study 10 Android mobile apps.\n\nIt found that the apps sent user data to at least 135 different third party services involved in advertising or behavioural profiling.\n\nHOW CAN YOU CHECK IF YOU ARE BEING CATFISHED?\n\nDating apps and online websites are plagued with fraudulent profiles, known as 'catfishes'.\n\n'Catfishing' originated as a term for the process of luring people into false relationships, however, it has also come to encompass people giving out false information about themselves more generally.\n\nThese profiles often use images of another person to allow users to pretend to be someone else in order to get a date, or scam money from a lonelyheart.\n\nFortunately, there are certain ways to check if these profiles are real people or if they are bogus accounts --\n\n1. Google reverse image search\n\nThis is probably the most valuable tool for catching out a catfish and can be done via Google.\n\nTo kickstart the process, people need only right-click the photos that are arousing their suspcions, copy the URL and paste it into images.google.com.\n\nThe search engine will search to see if the image has been used elsewhere.\n\nIf you find the picture associated with a different person to the one you're speaking to on your dating app, it's likely you've met a catfish!\n\n2. Use an app called Veracity\n\nIt is useful for dating sites such as Tinder, Bumble and Grindr as it allows images from Dropbox or Camera roll (or similar) to be cross-referenced against any matching results.\n\nLoad the app, then select a screenshot of the suspicious dating app profile from your camera roll to launch the search.\n\nThe app will tell you if the picture belongs to somebody else.\n\n3. Check their Facebook\n\nAlmost everyone who has a profile on a dating site will have a Facebook account (most dating apps require users to have one, after all!) so it is always advisable to track down your potential suitor on other forms of social media.\n\n4. Google them\n\nGoogle and other search engines have an extensive repertoire and most people will crop up in a search.\n\nIn this day and age, it's unusual for someone to have nothing on Google.\n\nHave a search through for them or their relatives, things they've said or posted in the past. If there's nothing, that should raise alarm bells.\n\n5. Skype\/Facetime\/Video Chat\n\nFor prospective romantic engagements, seeing the face of someone you are virtually talking to is essential.\n\n6. Money\n\nAnyone that asks for money online or via an app is likely to be a fraud.\n\nThis is probably a scam and should provide immediate red flags.",

The avatar in the WhatsApp profile also matched a photo on his Facebook page.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, de Caluwe said he was not involved in any surveillance of Yovanovitch and that the messages with Hyde were merely 'ridiculous banter'.\n\n'My engagement in this exchange with Rob is something that has no credibility,' de Caluwe said in the statement provided by spokeswoman Karyn Turk.\n\nDe Caluwe initially denied involvement in an alleged surveillance operation targeting Yovanovitch after Hyde identified him as the source of purported intelligence on the then-ambassador's movements last spring. Hyde and de Caluwe are pictured together in an undated Facebook photo\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, de Caluwe said he was not involved in any surveillance of Yovanovitch (pictured) and that the messages with Hyde were merely 'ridiculous banter'\n\nHe said he was 'apologetic for contributing to any confusion' by sending the messages about Yovanovitch.\n\n'My friendship with Rob was jovial and this exchange was just a part of a ridiculous banter,' he said.\n\n'Sometimes Rob's behavior was odd, nonsensical and often comical. I wasn't really sure what to make of this whole thing back then or now.'\n\nTurk said de Caluwe embarked on a 'playful exchange' of messages with Hyde about Yovanovitch last year after seeing posts about the ambassador on his Facebook page.\n\n'Anthony understands how these the exchanges released into media yesterday look,' Turk said.\n\n'He has never had any contacts in the Ukraine. He is a citizen of the Royal Netherlands. He doesn't know Lev Parnes [sic]. He stated that he was not involved in any surveillance of any Americans at any point in time.'\n\nLittle is known about de Caluwe's background, but past online postings indicate he has worked on finance and renewable energy business ventures in Central America\n\nText messages released last week by the House Intelligence Committee showed Hyde (pictured with Trump) relaying information about Yovanovitch's whereabouts to Lev Parnas, an associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani\n\nParnas (picture), who is facing charges for campaign finance violations, supplied his text exchanges with Hyde to House officials leading an impeachment inquiry against Trump\n\nLittle is known about de Caluwe's background, but past online postings indicate he has worked on finance and renewable energy business ventures in Central America.\n\nHe has apparently used the surnames Hemelrijk and Heavenrich.\n\nThe text messages between Hyde, de Caluwe and Parnas are now the focus of a state department inquiry into the alleged stalking and surveillance of Yovanovitch.\n\nThe diplomat was ousted from her job in Kyiv last May following an aggressive smear campaign orchestrated by Giuliani and his allies.\n\nGiuliani has said he viewed Yovanovitch as an obstacle to his efforts to have Ukrainian authorities investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter's dealings in the country.\n\nSpeaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July, Trump called Yovanovitch 'bad news' and said that she would 'go through some things'.\n\nThat same phone call is at the center of a whistleblower complaint from a US intelligence official that sparked the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nHyde addressed the text messages in a video he posted online Friday\n\nHyde, who earlier said he was drinking when he exchanged messages with former Giuliani sidekick Parnas, addressed the text messages in a video he posted online Friday.\n\n'Anthony De Caluwe, go look into him, my other side of my text messages,' he said in the video as he sat on a plush brown couch.\n\n'And why don't you ask them guys. Because it was just copy and paste bulls*** that from some intel guy probably that was f***ing with me. Trying to set Trump up. And I'm sure if I disappeared or died or they gag-ordered me, they were going to use me as a smoking gun. Some bulls*** like I have these Ukrainian ties,' he said.\n\nHyde, a Connecticut congressional candidate and who has donated to Trump and been photographed golfing with him, repeatedly attacked Rep. Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman and impeachment manager who is bringing two impeachment articles against him in the Senate.\n\n'Adam Schiff is a horrible person. Do the math. I'm Rob Hyde. That guy's been nothing but a piece of Schiff forever,' he said, using a Trump quip.\n\n'Ask him for the other side of my text messages since he likes to provide and spy on Americans ... Who was I talking to that was providing me this intel? Ask him. Come on Adam Schiff!'\n\nHe continued: 'Who was providing me that intel of me and the Ukraine spying on Marie Yavonovitch. Please. Who? You're a scumbag Adam Schiff. The world knows it. And the world's going to figure it out. You're nothing but a piece of Schiff.'\n\n'Adam Schiff put out the other transcripts for the guy I was talking to that I think Adam Schiff put there to f*** with me. So why doesn't everybody look at Anthony De Caluwe or whatever the heck his name is. Works for government departments - whatever he is,' Hyde rants in the video. 'Because honestly, I have no ties to Ukraine. I don't even know if Lev's Ukrainian, but he's probably the only one I know. Or knew. And I urge everybody to look into Adam Schiff and ask him for the other side of those transcripts, those text messages from WhatsApp. And ask Adam Schiff to provide them.'\n\nSchiff's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the video Hyde repeatedly attacked Rep Adam Schiff (pictured), the House Intelligence Committee chairman and impeachment manager who is bringing two impeachment articles against Trump in the Senate\n\nHyde's confirmation of receiving the information comes days after Parnas brushed off the disclosure following reports it could be evidence of a crime or even an intent to harm the ambassador.\n\nParnas told MSNBC Hyde was 'drunk all the time' and he didn't take the information seriously.\n\nFederal authorities are finally showing interest in the material, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the information will be investigated, and members of the FBI visited Hyde's Connecticut home on Thursday.\n\nHyde, who has posted pictures of himself at the White House bowling alley and at a Trump golf property, said he was just trying to get into a lobbying career.\n\n'Who I was talking to. Are you kidding? Like I have anybody over in the Ukraine. Are you serious? I'm a landscaper from Simsbury, Connecticut that's trying to get into the government relations, public relations world, lobbying world, whatever you want to call it,' he said.\n\nHyde further tamped down the alleged surveillance by saying he was far afield when he sent the messages, blasting Democrats for putting out information 'between Parnas and I while we were effing around and I was down in Ecuador I believe climbing volcanoes.'\n\nIn other texts, he attacks Parnas as a 'known con man' and calls himself an 'Honorable Marine.'\n\nPompeo on Friday finally called for an internal probe after the release of the bombshell texts that appeared to show Rudy Giuliani associates surveilling Yovanovitch.\n\nThe State Department had been silent for three days after the release by the House Intelligence Committee of messages to and from Parnas.\n\nSome of the messages show detailed information about the location and movements of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who had come under harsh criticism by Giuliani and his team who branded her as anti-Trump.\n\n'We will do everything we need to do to evaluate whether there was something that took place there,' Pompeo said.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo (pictured) on Friday vowed to investigate the alleged surveillance of Yovanovitch\n\nBut he also shared doubts at the get-go about the nature of what had occurred.\n\n'I suspect that much of what's been reported will ultimately prove wrong,' he said.\n\nPompeo on Friday broke nearly 72 hours of silence on the subject, saying he an obligation to evaluate and investigate the matter relating to an American posted overseas and placed under protection of U.S. diplomatic security.\n\nIn interviews with conservative radio hosts, Pompeo said he had no knowledge of the allegations until earlier this week when congressional Democrats released documents from an associate of President Donald Trump's personal attorney suggesting that Marie Yovanovitch was being watched. He also said he did not know and had never met Lev Parnas, the associate of Rudy Giuliani who made the claims.\n\nPompeo, who was traveling in California when the documents were released, had been harshly criticized by lawmakers and current and former diplomats for not addressing the matter. The documents provided by Parnas suggested there may have been a threat to Yovanovitch shortly before she was abruptly recalled last spring.\n\n'We will do everything we need to do to evaluate whether there was something that took place there,' he said in a radio interview with Tony Katz, an Indianapolis-based broadcaster. 'I suspect that much of what\u00b4s been reported will ultimately prove wrong, but our obligation, my obligation as secretary of state, is to make sure that we evaluate, investigate. Any time there is someone who posits that there may have been a risk to one of our officers, we\u00b4ll obviously do that.'\n\n'It is always the case at the Department of State that we do everything we can to ensure that our officers, not only our ambassadors but our entire team, has the security level that\u00b4s appropriate,' Pompeo said.\n\n'We do our best to make sure that no harm will come to anyone, whether that was what was going on in our embassy in Baghdad last week or the work that was going on in Kyiv up and through the spring of last year when Ambassador Yovanovitch was there, and in our embassy in Kyiv even today,' he said.\n\nPompeo made similar but less specific comments to conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt.\n\nUntil he spoke, the State Department had declined repeated requests to offer any public defense of Yovanovitch, drawing fire from many.\n\n'They will let me know when she's on the move': Hyde said he was 'down in Ecuador I believe climbing volcanoes' at the time of the messages\n\nOne cryptic series of texts from Hyde mentioned Yovanovitch security and asked 'what I would like to do and what is in it for them'\n\nThe allegations, if true, are central to the impeachment inquiry into Trump, who faces a charge that he abused his presidential power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid to the country as leverage. Trump says the inquiry is a 'hoax.'\n\nAt the time, Trump\u00b4s allies were trying to have Yovanovitch, who was seen as a roadblock to a Biden investigation, removed from her post. She was recalled in late May ahead of the end of her tour.\n\nYovanovitch returned to Washington after being told in a late-night phone call to get on the next plane home for her own safety by the director general of the Foreign Service, according to witness testimony in the impeachment inquiry. The nature of any possible threat was not specified and remains unclear, although the Parnas documents suggest the surveillance was a prelude to some kind of action.\n\nRobert Hyde, the Republican congressional candidate who exchanged text messages with Lev Parnas about the physical movements of Yovanovitch, claims he was drinking when he wrote about surveillance of her.\n\n'For them to take some texts my buddy's and I wrote back to some dweeb we were playing with that we met a few times while we had a few drinks is definitely laughable. Schiff is a desperate turd playing with this Lev guy,' he wrote.\n\nMany of the texts provide information about Yovanovitch's security package not long before she was suddenly removed from her post.\n\n'She under heavy protection outside Kiev,' Hyde wrote in one.\n\nTwo days later, he wrote: 'They are moving her tomorrow.' Then he added: 'The guys over there asked me what I would like to do and what is in it for them.'\n\n'Private security. Been there since Thursday,' he wrote in another message. 'They will let me know when she's on the move.'\n\n'They are willing to help if we\/you would like a price,' Hyde added in another message that day.\n\n'Guess you can do anything in the Ukraine with money ... what I was told,' he wrote.\n\n'Can't believe Trump hasn't fired this b****' Hyde says writes at one point.\n\nYovanovitch's lawyer had demanded an investigation after the texts came out.",

It is located close to the Tokyo Stadium in Chofu City. At the 2020 Olympic Games, the Musashino Forest Sport Plaza will host the badminton, modern pentathlon fencing and Paralympic wheelchair basketball events. The capacity of the Musashino Forest Sport Plaza during the Games will be 7,200 spectators, though later the capacity of the main hall will be increased to 10,000 spectators.\n\nBadminton competitions debuted at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. There were four competitions featuring singles and doubles events for both men and woman. The most successful athletes currently in badminton hail from China.\n\nThe modern pentathlon is consists of five events: fencing, swimming (free style), equestrian jumping, pistol shooting and cross-country running or the laser-run. The original idea for the pentathlon was based on the skills needed by the ideal soldier. Modern pentathlon has been part of the Olympic Games since 1912. In the past the competition lasted for five days, but from 1996 a one-day format was approved.\n\nPerhaps the most famous nearby place of interest is the exceedingly popular anime studio Ghibli Museum. This museum is so popular that you must book your tickets well in advanced. Tickets really do sell out quickly but for fans of the anime studio, the Ghibli Museum is must visit. Japan Travel offers a great opportunity to visit with its Ghibli Museum Tour.\n\nAlong with the museum, the area features one of Tokyo's most popular public spaces, the beautifully spacious Inokashira Park. Famous for its cherry blossoms in spring, the park's pond and swan pedal boats are well-loved while the island shrine and small zoo only add to the park's appeal.",

South Africa were made to follow-on and were 15-0 when the rain came but once the skies cleared, Wood quickly removed opener Dean Elgar (15) and the struggling Zubayr Hamza for two.",

He was sentenced to four months prison.\n\nThose victims were aged nine to 14, with one being his neighbour who he was babysitting\n\nLast week. three of his victims faced him in court, reading out their impact statements.\n\nRead here: Child sex abuse victim's life broken beyond repair\n\nYoung victim groomed with chocolate now repulsed by treat\n\n\"When innocence is taken from a child, they are broken in a way that can never be repaired,\" Gina said.\n\n\"My whole life I have grown up feeling guilty and ashamed for something I had no control over.\n\n\"Your actions changed me, like someone turned the light out, like a part of me was taken away never to be replaced.\"\n\nCrown prosecutor Tiffany Lawrence said the offending took place over 15 years, in the 1970s and 1980s, in Gladstone and Ipswich.\n\n\"At the time, their ages ranged as young as four to 11-years-old,\" she said.\n\n\"There was a 16-year disparity at least with every complainant, some as many as 30 years.\"\n\nFiona was four or five and her sister Gina was 10 or 11 when they were abused by the defendant.\n\nFiona and Gina had travelled to Gladstone from Ipswich ahead of their parents and stayed with the defendant when he placed a ball down his pants and procured Fiona to \"find it\".\n\nOn another occasions, the girls and their parents were camping with the defendant and others when he entered Fiona's tents and she woke to find him touching her breasts under her shirt.\n\nGina was sleeping while her parents were practising choir songs when the defendant entered her room.\n\nThe court heard the defendant placed Gina on top of him and rubbed his erect penis on her vagina.\n\nOn another occasion, he told her he wanted \"a proper hug\" and carried out the same act.\n\n\"Since your actions, I have been filled with self-loathing. This has resulted in me having a life long battle with my weight,\" Gina said.\n\n\"I became quite a heavy drinker to try and numb the pain and when that didn't work, I turned to drugs - lots of drugs. I became addicted to ice in my mid-20s resulting in a debt of over $20,000.\"\n\nAbbey*, who was the defendant's cousin, stayed over at his home when she was abused. He lied down next to her and exposed his penis, grabbed her hand and made her touch it many times, telling her it was a \"game\".\n\nBeth*, 10, was with her family travelling from Ipswich to Gladstone because her father was due to give a sermon at Sunday's service.\n\nMs Lawrence said Beth, from Ipswich, stayed with the defendant while her parents stayed in a motel.\n\nShe was woken in the morning with the defendant exposing his penis to her, telling her that he wanted to \"play rudies\" with her.\n\nHe continued abusing her until the sunlight came into the room.\n\nChristine* was only seven or eight when her family travelled to Gladstone in 1974 and stayed with the defendant for two weeks.\n\nShe was a cousin of the defendant by marriage, but referred to him as 'uncle'.\n\nThe sexual abuse committed against her was carried out on three separate days.\n\nFirst, he was in bed with her and put his hands up her shirt and pinched her nipple. Then he encouraged her to take a shower and change into her pyjamas in front of him.\n\nMs Lawrence said Christine got back in bed with the defendant and he put his hand down her pants, then grabbed her hand and placed it on his penis and told her to squeeze it.\n\nOn a separate occasion, while his wife showered and dressed, the defendant placed his hand down Christine's pants and touched her vagina.\n\nDebbie*, four, was sitting with her sister and the defendant watching cartoons while on holiday and staying at the defendant's home.\n\n\"He took her hand, placed it on his penis and asked 'do you want to play with this',\" Ms Lawrence said.\n\nDebbie told the defendant no. She recalls feeling something \"soft and squishy\".\n\nElisa*, 10 or 11, drove with the defendant to the post office in Ipswich when he stayed with her family. He used the telephone at the post office to call his wife.\n\nOn the way back to Elisa's, he stopped the car, touched her breasts and told her if she \"massaged them they would grow\".\n\nMs Lawrence said the victims were in the back of the court during sentencing, supported by their mothers and other family members.\n\nThe court heard the defendant's wife was also in court, supporting her husband.\n\nMs Lawrence said two aggravating features were the many victims and the exploitation of his position of trust from the church and family.\n\nDefence barrister Jordan Ahlstrand said his client, who had worked all of his life, apologised to each complainant for his offending behaviour.\n\nJudge Michael Burnett said each of the seven victim impact statements was compelling and compassionate, showing the women were \"clearly intelligent\", educated and articulate people.\n\n\"I do not think they embellished,\" he said.\n\nDebbie, whose sister was also abused by the defendant, told the court she lived with guilt for a long time for not rescuing her sister, whose trauma was worse than hers.\n\nShe said another 'uncle' tried to manipulate her mother to stop the girls from talking about their abuse by telling her mother the defendant was threatening suicide.\n\n\"I felt I couldn't trust my family anymore,\" Debbie said.\n\nShe said her mother, who had married into the family, was ostracised along with the victims.\n\n*The victims' real names have been changed to protect their identity.",

There were many families and children present with a peaceful atmosphere until police ordered the crowds to leave.\n\nThe frequency and ferocity of Hong Kong's protests have died down over the last month, but signs of the political unrest are everywhere, from graffiti daubed on walls to huge fences surrounding government buildings.\n\nThe city's police force is now loathed by large swathes of the city, heckled by crowds both at protest sites and in their local neighbourhoods.\n\nCritics accuse police of using excessive force, with no police officer disciplined or punished in the last seven months of protests.\n\nPolice say they have used force commensurate with the levels of violence they face from hardcore protesters who routinely throw bricks and petrol bombs.\n\nThe force has blamed viral social media videos of officers making hard arrests and media coverage for their plummeting reputation among the city's inhabitants.\n\nAmong key demands of the protest movement is an independent inquiry into the police, an amnesty for 7,000 people arrested and fully free elections.\n\nBeijing and local leader Carrie Lam have refused further concessions and defended police tactics.",

                "body": "A massive dust storm has enveloped parts of Central West of NSW, turning the sky dark and blanketing communities in a thick coat of red dust.\n\nVideos posted to social media showed dust storms descending on Dubbo and nearby towns that were so thick they blocked out the sun.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology issued a series of severe thunderstorm warnings on Sunday evening for inland NSW with the associated winds generating massive dust clouds.\n\nA gust of 94 km\/h was recorded at Parkes about 6.30pm while a gust of 107 km\/h was recorded at Dubbo about 7.45pm, the BOM said.\n\nBureau meteorologist Rose Barr said Sunday's significant rain was concentrated across central and northern parts of the state on, and east, of the ranges.\n\nMany towns on the Mid North Coast and the northern rivers region received between 100 and 180 millimetres from 9am to 10.30pm on Sunday.\n\nIn the southern part of the state, high winds saw storms race overhead quickly, resulting in lower measured falls.\n\nDownpours over the past few days have provided relief for parts of drought-stricken NSW and helped firefighters slow the spread of bushfires and build containment lines ahead of increased fire danger mid-week.\n\nThe thunderstorms will continue on Monday.\n\n\"Tomorrow we have a very active thunderstorm day forecast, particularly across southeastern and central-eastern parts of the state, as well as parts of the southwest slopes,\" Ms Barr said.\n\nBut again they are likely to move quickly with some \"extremely strong wind gusts\". There could also be large hailstones.\n\nWinds will shift and come more from the north and west mid-week, bringing drier and warmer air on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\"That means on both of those days we may end up seeing fire dangers increasing again and causing more problems for our fire agencies,\" Ms Barr said.\n\nBut moisture will thankfully return on Friday and the weekend.\n\nThe death toll from the state's unprecedented bushfires climbed to 21 this weekend following the death in hospital of an elderly man burned in Cobargo on New Year's Eve.\n\nThe 84-year-old was taken from his home on December 31 to South East Regional Hospital before he was transferred to Concord Hospital in Sydney where he died in the early hours of Saturday.",

                "title": "Syriana Analysis: Why the US hated General Soleimani -- Sott.net",
                "body": "I'm sure you have heard a lot about General Soleimani from the mainstream media and his alleged crimes against the Americans in the Middle East. In the video below, I will tell you the real story behind the US hatred towards Soleimani and why he was assassinated.\n\nFirst of all, the allegation made by the MSM that Soleimani is responsible for killing more than 600 soldiers in Iraq is completely fake news. The source of this allegation is the Pentagon; the same source that lied on Iraq's WMD wants you to believe that Soleimani supported groups in Iraq that killed American soldiers after the illegal occupation of Iraq in 2003. So, firstly, the US occupation of Iraq was illegal according to international law and any agreement with successive Iraqi government after the occupation should be considered null and void. And secondly, the Pentagon is made up this allegation to demonize Iran during the era of George W. Bush and put Tehran in Washington's \"axis of evil\" list, despite the fact Iran and Soleimani were cooperating with the US back then in order to fight Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.\n\nSo let's go back to the real reasons behind the US hatred towards Soleimani: Late Soleimani has taken charge of Al-Quds force in the Iranian revolutionary guard in 1998. One of his first trips was to Lebanon, particularly to the Lebanese Hizbollah that was back then engaged in a war of attrition with Israel. Hizbollah was not strong enough, so its strategy was to exhaust the Israeli army that was occupation south Lebanon. Soleimani increased the Iranian support to Hizbollah, and alongside the military support of Syria's late President Hafez al-Assad, Hizbollah managed to kick out Israel from south Lebanon in the year 2000 and liberate most of the Lebanese territories, in exception of Shabaa farms and Kafr Shouba hills. When the liberation happened, Soleimani told Hizbollah that Israel will certainly try to take revenge, therefore the Lebanese group must prepare itself for another round of war. Thus, Soleimani increased the Iranian support to Hizbollah in a bid to change the strategy of Hizbollah from only exhausting Israel into fighting as equals with Tel Aviv. Of course, this was not possible due to the air superiority of Israel, so Iran and Syria made their weapon stores available for Hizbollah, particularly the mid-range missiles and the anti-tank rockets. Additionally, Tehran and Damascus transferred their military expertise to Hizbollah, in order to produce their weaponry instead of shipping them from Iran or Syria. So, when Israel invaded Lebanon once again in 2006, Hizbollah managed to kick the invading army out of Lebanon thanks to this military support. Soleimani himself was present in Lebanon during the war in 2006 and he put his military expertise at the service of Hizbollah.\n\nAfter 2006, Soleimani took the Iranian support of Hizbollah to an advanced level, in order to create a deterrence with Israel. And the truth is since 2006, Israel didn't dare to invade Lebanon again. This was mainly thanks to Soleimani.\n\nIn 2011, the proxy war erupted in Syria, where the US and Israel wanted to overthrow Bashar al-Assad and destroy the Syrian regional power through proxy forces, mainly the Islamist groups, such as the FSA, Al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, Islam's Army, etc. Even ISIS at some point was getting tacit support from the US by turning a blind for their rapid expansion in north Syria and looting the Syrian oil and selling it in Turkey; a NATO member state, which hosts one of the biggest NATO bases in south Turkey.\n\nFormer foreign minister John Kerry once said in a leaked audio conversation with anti-Assad activists that the US was watching the expansion of ISIS because they thought the existential threat of ISIS will force Assad to compromise.\n\nBut Soleimani rushed to Damascus, organized thousands of well-trained fighters, and himself commanded the fighting against ISIS and Al-Qaeda. Soleimani's impact on the war on terror was tremendous and foiled the US plot in Syria.\n\nThe same thing happened in Iraq, where the US had a similar plan in destroying the Iranian influence in Iraq through ISIS. And let's not forget that when ISIS was advancing towards Irbil in order to commit genocide against the Kurds as it did with the Yezidis, it was Soleimani who rushed to help the Kurds and other minorities such as the Assyrians through the Iraqi popular mobilization forces. In conclusion, although the US claims that it has a mutual ground with Iran, which is fighting salafi terrorism, it is the US who used terrorism against Iran and its allies in the region. And Soleimani's role was essential in defeating not only terrorism in Syria and Iraq but also in stopping the expansion of Israel in Lebanon and Gaza. This is why the US and Israel wanted Soleimani dead. And any other allegation is completely made up and fake news.",

                "body": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sunday accused many of the Governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, of being products of huge electoral manipulations.\n\nIt said it was against this alleged backdrop that the APC governors are standing alone in defence of the widely condemned judgment of the Supreme Court on Imo governorship election.\n\nThe opposition party also insisted on a review of the apex court judgement.\n\nThe party's spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan said this in a statement in Abuja.\n\nHe added, \"The party says the APC governors' attempt at cheap blackmail will never stop the PDP and millions of Nigerians from demanding for the review and reversal of the judgment in which the Supreme Court manufactured and donated fictitious votes to name a 4th position candidate the winner of the Imo state governorship election.\n\n\"It is rather not surprising to many that the APC governors could allow themselves to be enlisted to haul insults at the PDP with a view to blur and distort this grave miscarriage of justice because many of them are products and beneficiaries of electoral manipulations.\n\n\"The APC governors' part in this script appears very glaring. Of course, who else will the flies support except a person with open smelly sore?\n\n\"This is also why APC governors are encouraging their party to engage in underhand measures and supporting injustice instead of following democratic processes.\n\n\"In comparing the Imo state judgment to that of Zamfara and Rivers states governorship elections, the APC governors forgot that Nigerians are abreast of the facts.\n\n\"The APC governors deliberately veiled the fact that they lost Zamfara and Rivers as a result of their internal wrangling over their failure to conduct a credible primary, which voided their votes and left the party with the second-highest number of votes as the winner.\n\n\"This is different from the judgment on Imo where fictitious votes were manufactured by the Supreme Court and donated to the APC to lift it from the fourth position and declared winner.\n\n\"In making their plea for the rejected judgment, the APC governors should explain to Nigerians how the Supreme Court, in its bid to award votes to APC, ended up declaring a total valid votes of 950, 952 votes above the INEC's official 823,743 total number of accredited voters for the election.\n\n\"Can the APC governors explain to Nigerians how and where the Supreme Court manufactured the extra 127,743 vote above the number of accredited voters.\n\n\"What can they say to the fact that the Supreme Court could not produce the details of the votes from each of the fictitious 388 polling units, upon which it based the ruling?\n\n\"Furthermore, can the APC governors explain why the Supreme Court somersaulted on its declaration on a host of cases, particularly the Atiku vs Buhari case, that for a petitioner to succeed in allegation - of infraction of any provision of the Electoral Act, especially one complaining about malpractice, the petitioner must call witnesses polling unit by polling units.\n\n\"The APC governors should, therefore, steer clear of the Imo judgment as the PDP will never abandon the determination to get the judgment reversed\".",

                "body": "Mark Wood said he is worried England's hopes of winning the rain-hit third Test could be put in jeopardy by the weather on the final day.\n\nEngland need four wickets to complete a victory over South Africa that would give them a 2-1 series lead heading into Fridays's final Test in Johannesburg. South Africa ended the fourth day on 102 for six having been forced to follow on.\n\nA gloomy forecast for the final day provides South Africa with hope they could still save the match, even if a Test-best haul of four for 31 from Joe Root, and two wickets for Wood, in the Durham fast bowler's first Test for 11 months, make that scenario unlikely.\n\n\"I thought Africa was the sunniest place in the world and then I come back and it's like Durham,\" Wood said. \"I'd be lying if I wasn't a little bit worried. But because we're in a hot country and the wind's blowing, you hope it's going to dry quickly if the wind stops.\n\n\"We managed to get a lot of cricket in today and we played really well. If we have the same attitude tomorrow we'll be in a good place.\"\n\nWood, whose last Test appearance was against West Indies in St Lucia last February, had not played a competitive game since sustaining knee and side injuries during the World Cup final against New Zealand in July.\n\nDespite a positive return, Wood is unsure whether his body will allow him to play consecutive Tests and appear in the final Test at the Wanderers, a venue renowned for having one of the fastest pitches in the world.\n\n\"That's too far to look ahead especially with my body,\" he said. \"I don't like to say, 'my body feels good' every time and feed you false information. I've just got to see how it goes.\n\n\"I'm in a good place at the minute, I've been bowling well in the nets, getting through this game well. We'll just wait and see.\n\n\"I've waited quite a while to come back. July was last game I played, so I was trying to have fun, take it all in, play with smile on my face. With the way my body has been, it's something you can't take it for granted, it could be my last game.\n\n\"Being a fast bowler you want to play on quick decks. I'd love to play there. I've trained there once and it flew through. I'd love to have a go, I've never played a match there so we'll wait and see what happens. But there's a job to do here first. We'll get through this and see what happens.\"\n\nThere were also words of praise for Root, whose off-spin played a decisive role in the final session of this fourth day. \"I think because he's captain, he under-bowls himself a lot. He does get key wickets when he bowls and he's been working on it a lot in the nets. I don't know if you've seen in practice, he's doing a lot more bowling.\n\n\"As a group we're really pleased for him to see him get four wickets. Hopefully he'll get the five-for tomorrow.\"\n\nWood's fellow fast bowler Jofra Archer is progressing well from the elbow injury that has ruled him out of the past two matches, raising hopes he will be fit for the final Test.",

                "title": "Emotional Westwood grabs Abu Dhabi title",
                "body": "The two-time European Tour number one started the final round one ahead of his closest rivals Bernd Wiesberger and Francesco Laporta, and even though several players made a charge towards him, he never relinquished his lead throughout the day.\n\nThree months short of turning 47, England's Lee Westwood put together a masterclass in leading from the front as he won the $7 million Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship on Sunday by two shots.\n\nThe two-time European Tour number one started the final round one ahead of his closest rivals Bernd Wiesberger and Francesco Laporta, and even though several players made a charge towards him, he never relinquished his lead throughout the day.\n\nWestwood made six birdies in his round of five-under par 67 to finish on 19-under par 269 for his 25th title on the European Tour and his 44th internationally. Currently ranked 63rd in the world, he is expected to rise to number 29 on Monday.\n\nHe also became only the third player on the European Tour to win in four different decades after Ireland's Des Smyth and Zimbabwean Mark McNulty. Westwood's first win came in the 1996 Scandinavian Masters.\n\nTwo-time Abu Dhabi champion Tommy Fleetwood and Frenchman Victor Perez closed with rounds of nine-under par 63 to set the clubhouse mark on 17-under par 271. They were later joined at that score by England's Matthew Fitzpatrick (67), but that was good enough only for a tied second place.\n\n\"Fantastic. I am ecstatic, elated and a bit emotional. Just great to keep playing well, and you know, show that I am still good enough,\" said a teary-eyed Westwood. \"I was trying not to look at leaderboards. I peeked at a few on the way around the back nine.\n\n\"It was some quality golf. I really felt quite calm on the greens this week and rolled a lot of good putts. That was the key to winning, really. You've got to putt well to win any tournament, but especially here in the desert because the greens are so immaculate.\"\n\nWestwood immediately gave himself some breathing space with birdies on the second and third holes. He then picked up shots on the fifth and eighth holes to make the turn at four-under par.\n\nThe Englishman then saved a crucial par on the 11th hole and his tee shot on the 12th almost spun back into the water. Undeterred, he sank his birdie putt from the fringe.\n\nWestwood's only bogey was on the 16th hole which reduced his lead to one shot, but he kept his calm with a measured par on the 17th and then hit two magnificent shots into the par-5 18th for a final birdie. Westwood will now get into every major and World Golf Championship event and it has reignited his desire to make it to the European Ryder Cup team for the 11th time.\n\n\"I'm not sure I can take any more Ryder Cups,\" he quipped. \"Played ten, and it was good watching the lads last time. But you know, obviously if there's a chance of that, then I might as well go for it. It's nice just to come out and keep proving that you've still got it.\"\n\nFleetwood, who turned 29 on Sunday, looked like heading for a double celebration but he could not make a final birdie on the 18th which would have put some pressure on Westwood and given him a share of the course record. \"It was good, really good. Felt like I gradually got better through the week. I struggled on Thursday and then had a really good practice session and played well on Friday when it was tough conditions. And yesterday, I hit a couple of ropey drives and missed a couple of putts and that 5-under was really the worst there could have been,\" said Fleetwood.\n\n\"It's weird, a little disappointed on the last, just gave the tee shot away, and even the wedge wasn't great. But you couldn't really complain about 63 on the final day.\"\n\nFitzpatrick put some heat on Westwood early in the round when he started with three birdies in four holes, but after picking up another shot on the par-5 eighth, he had a string of pars before closing with another birdie on the 18th.\n\nPerez birdied the 17th and eagled the 18th to match Fleetwood's 63.\n\nWorld number one Brooks Koepka completed a decent finish after a 14-week layoff because of stem cell treatment in his injured left knee with a round of 69. He was tied 34th at eight-under par 280.\n\nFinal scores\n\n269 - Lee Westwood (ENG) 69-68-65-67\n\n271 - Tommy Fleetwood (ENG) 71-70-67-63, Victor Perez (FRA) 70-70-68-63, Matthew Fitzpatrick (ENG) 68-67-69-67\n\n273 - Louis Oosthuizen (RSA) 69-68-70-66\n\n274 - Shaun Norris (RSA) 64-77-68-65, Ross Fisher (ENG) 70-71-66-67\n\n275 - Scott Jamieson (SCO) 71-72-67-65, Martin Kaymer (GER) 68-73-69-65, Sergio Garcia (ESP) 67-69-69-70, Bernd Wiesberger (AUT) 69-69-65-72\n\n276 - Erik Van Rooyen (RSA) 73-68-69-66, Paul Waring (ENG) 71-71-67-67, Sam Horsfield (ENG) 73-69-67-67, Jack Singh Brar (ENG) 70-70-68-68, Rafa Cabrera-Bello (ESP) 67-68-71-70\n\n277 - Masahiro Kawamura (JPN) 69-71-70-67, Branden Grace (RSA) 68-72-69-68, Scott Hend (AUS) 69-70-69-69, Francesco Laporta (ITA) 71-63-69-74\n\nSelected:\n\n280 - Brooks Koepka (USA) 66-75-70-69, Patrick Cantlay (USA) 71-66-72-71\n\n281 - Li Haotong (CHN) 67-69-74-71",

Pennock saw an effort saved but Green was on hand to fire home her first goal.\n\nThe Blades then added three more to their tally in 10 minutes after the break. First, Pennock was played in by Wilkinson and slotted home into the corner, before five minutes later she chested down Veatriki Sarri's cross and fired a half volley into the corner. Wilkinson then came up with the moment of the match to seal it when her effort from 25 yards flew in off the crossbar to put the gloss on a comfortable performance.\n\nWilkinson said: \"Coming into this game, everyone put in a good performance, everybody followed the game plan and that's why we've not just won the game but scored five goals.\"",

                "body": "Liverpool (AFP) - Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has revealed Marcus Rashford will be sidelined for at least six weeks after suffering a stress fracture in his back.\n\nRashford was forced off less than 15 minutes after coming on as a second half substitute in a FA Cup third round replay win over Wolves on Wednesday.\n\nHe was absent for United's 2-0 defeat at Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking after the match at Anfield, Solskjaer said the England international is not expected to return to training for six weeks, meaning he might not be back in a United shirt for two months.\n\n\"He's suffered a bad injury. Yeah it's a (back) stress fracture, it happened against Wolves. It's not happened before, it happened there and then,\" Solskjaer told Sky Sports.\n\n\"He'll be out for a while. He won't be back until after the mid-season break. Normally six weeks to heal, but I'm not a doctor, and then he needs rehab after that probably.\"\n\nUnited face either Watford or Tranmere in the FA Cup fourth round, travel to Manchester City for the second leg of their League Cup semi-final -- trailing 3-1 from the first leg -- and host Wolves in the Premier League in the next two weeks.\n\nSolskjaer's men then have a 16-day period to rest and recuperate thanks to the Premier League's first ever winter break before travelling to Chelsea on February 17.\n\nBut Rashford is unlikely to be back in action until well into March, even if his rehabilitation goes according to plan.\n\nIt is another blow for United as they battle to qualify for the Champions League via a top four finish in the Premier League.\n\nSolskjaer could be forced to buy a striker in the January transfer window to cover for Rashford's absence, although he can also turn to teenage forward Mason Greenwood, who has enjoyed an impressive breakthrough season with United.\n\n\"We've had many injuries to big players this season, it's just an unfortunate position that we are in. The window is open and it might be that we look at something for the short term,\" Solskjaer said.\n\n\"We are not desperately looking at a striker. We are looking at numbers and if the right one is there for us then something might be possible.\"\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate will also be frustrated by the news after he saw Tottenham striker Harry Kane sidelined for several months by a torn hamstring suffered over Christmas.",

                "body": "Washington DC - The 2020 election is approaching. Iowa is set to vote for its choice on a Democratic candidate in a few weeks. Many on the Left hope impeaching the President will convince enough independents and Trump-Democrats to choose the Democratic nominee in the general election.\n\nSome of the President's most ardent political supporters are evangelicals. He has relentlessly given them what they wanted. Whether it's providing pro-life Supreme Court Justices, preventing non-White Christians from Mexico from entering the country, or removing protections for the LGBTQ community, the commander-in-chief delivers for his faith-based fans.\n\nHowever, getting elected isn't just about what an elected official has done for his constituents, it's also about what they will do in the future. Time magazine reports how Trump recently promised big results for Christians:\n\n\"We will not allow faithful Americans to be bullied by the hard left,\" Trump said at a rally with evangelical supporters at a Florida megachurch on Jan. 3. \"Very soon, I'll be taking action to safeguard students' and teachers' First Amendment rights to pray in our schools. We're doing a big action, Attorney General Bill Barr.\"\n\nNo one expected what came next.\n\nSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos signed new regulations tying federal funding for schools with religious zealots. Under what's now called the DeVos Doctrine one local street preacher will be assigned to a school. That's right, every kindergarten, elementary, middle, and high school will have its own preacher-man.\n\nEach street preacher will be provided with funding by the local municipality to purchase whatever tools of the trade they need. Proponents of the DeVos Doctrine point out megaphones and signs that read It's not hate speech; it's love speech! are not cheap.\n\nSchool street preachers (SSPs) will provide other important services, too. SSPs will have executive control regarding field trips. They will determine which abortion clinic the third graders will protest.\n\nRepublicans are ecstatic about the new regulations.\n\nDemocrats are praying that the country will turn blue on November 3rd.",

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres thanked Merkel for her \"absolutely remarkable\" efforts.\n\n\"I cannot stress enough the summit's conclusion that there is no military solution to the conflict in Libya,\" he told reporters in Berlin.\n\n\"I hope the commitments made today will contribute to a lasting solution to the Libya crisis,\" Guterres said.\n\nThe U.N. chief said that \"we need to have a cease-fire.\n\n\"We cannot monitor something that doesn't exist,\" Guterres said. \"We have a truce.\"\n\nGuterres said all the participants committed to \"put pressure on the parties for a full cease-fire to be reached.\"\n\nMerkel hosted leaders from 11 countries outside Libya as well as the United Nations, the European Union, the African Union and the Arab League.\n\nLibya's two main rival leaders, Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj and Gen. Khalifa Hifter, also came to Berlin.\n\nAsked whether Sarraj and Hifter were part of the talks in Berlin, Merkel said: \"We spoke with them individually because the differences between them are so great that they aren't speaking with each other at the moment.\"\n\nMerkel and her foreign minister met both men at the chancellery before the summit began. Merkel said the two men agreed to name members of a military committee that will represent them at talks on a more permanent cease-fire.\n\nGuterres said that the committee would be convened \"in Geneva in the coming days.\"\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that \"we know that today's signatures aren't enough.\"\n\nHe said countries that weren't invited Sunday will be given the opportunity to participate in future meetings of the four committees dealing with various aspects of the crisis, among them military issues and the economy.\n\n\"We know that the work has only just started,\" Maas said, but praised the \"spirit of cooperation\" seen in Berlin.\n\nThe U.N. envoy on Libya, Ghassan Salame, said \"now I'm thinking about tomorrow.\" He said that Sunday's meeting had given the process a boost.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nGermany brought together the key players in Libya's long-running civil war on Sunday, seeking to curb foreign military interference, solidify a cease-fire and help relaunch a political process to stop the chaos in the North African nation.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed leaders from 11 countries outside Libya as well as the United Nations, the European Union, the African Union and the Arab League to the summit at the chancellery in Berlin. Germany's months-long diplomatic drive seeks to bolster U.N. efforts to stop the fighting in Libya.\n\nAmong those attending were Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nLibya's two main rival leaders, Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj and Gen. Khalifa Hifter, also came to Berlin. Merkel and her foreign minister met both men at the chancellery before the summit began. They weren't in a group photo at the beginning of the event, and further details of their participation were not immediately available.\n\n\"We are here for an urgent and pressing reason: to stop Libya's downward spiral,\" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the conference.\n\nIts chances of producing any real progress on the ground were unclear, however. A truce brokered earlier this month by Russia and Turkey marked the first break in fighting in months, but the cease-fire has seen repeated violations.\n\nDifferences were in full view ahead of the meeting. Speaking Sunday in Istanbul, Erdogan said the world had failed to respond adequately to Hifter's \"reckless attacks\" on Sarraj's U.N.-recognized government.\n\n\"Hopes that flourish again with the cease-fire and the Berlin summit should not be sacrificed to the ambitions of the merchants of blood and chaos,\" he said.\n\nErdogan met Putin in Berlin just before the summit. The Russian leader said \"we will sincerely strive for the conflict to be resolved.\"\n\nLibya has sunk further into chaos since the 2011 ouster and killing of its longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi. It is now divided into rival administrations, each backed by different nations: the U.N.-recognized government based in Tripoli, headed by Sarraj, and one based in the country's east, supported by Hifter's forces.\n\nHifter's forces have been on the offensive since April, laying siege to Tripoli in an effort to capture the capital. Hifter's forces are backed by Egypt, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, while the Tripoli government has turned to Turkey for troops and weapons.\n\nOn Sunday, Libya's National Oil Corporation said that guards under the command of Hifter's forces shut down two key oil fields in the country's southwestern desert, following the earlier closure of all eastern export terminals. Only offshore fields and one smaller facility remain operational, the corporation said.\n\nGermany's priority is to try to get the outside players that have interests in the conflict on the same page, stem the flow of weapons to Libya and ensure that the cease-fire sticks -- creating space for U.N.-led efforts to re-establish a political process in Libya.\n\n\"At the Libya conference, we must see above all that the arms embargo is once again complied with -- it has been agreed in principle at U.N. level but unfortunately not kept to,\" Merkel said.\n\nGermany is also keen to keep the fighting in Libya from further destabilizing the region, potentially setting off new waves of migrants seeking safety in Europe across the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who met Hifter in Libya on Thursday, said the general pledged to respect the cease-fire even though he had left Moscow days before without signing a draft on the truce. Sarraj did sign the document.\n\nU.N. chief Gutteres said it is time to \"seize the momentum and strengthen cease-fire arrangements.\"\n\n\"We reiterate our call to all those directly or indirectly involved in the conflict to do everything to support an effective cessation of hostilities and silence the guns,\" Guterres said in remarks released by his office.\n\n\"Incessant, blatant violations of the Security Council-imposed arms embargo must stop,\" he said.\n\nGerman officials have been careful to keep expectations in check, saying that the conference can only be the start of a process toward peace.\n\nPope Francis offered his encouragement from the Vatican on Sunday.\n\n\"I strongly hope that this summit, so important, is the start of a path toward the cessation of violence and a negotiated solution that leads to peace and much desired stability,\" Francis said in St. Peter's Square.\n\n-- -- --\n\nAndrew Wilks in Ankara, Turkey, Jim Heintz in Moscow and Frances D'Emilio in Rome contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

I just tell myself to make the next save and keep on going.\"\n\nAnd because Gagnon is only a sophomore, he knows he has to show that he belongs out there on the ice.\n\n\"Every time I step on the ice I need to prove myself,\" he said.\n\nWith the Bay State Conference win, the Redhawks (4-2-1, 2-1-2 BSC) prevented Wellesley head coach Paul Donato from recording his 300th career win as the Raiders fell to 3-3-1 (1-2-1 BSC).\n\n\"I honestly didn't know that he was going for 300,\" first-year Natick head coach Bill LaCouture Jr. said. \"I've got the utmost respect for him. He's an unbelievable coach and person. He's someone I've known for a long, long time and tonight wasn't about that for us. For us, we just feel that you always have to win your Bay State games, and this was a great hockey game against a really good Wellesley team.\n\n\"Our guys are playing a high level of hockey and that was one (heck) of a team our guys beat tonight. Their goalie was phenomenal and Luc was great for us tonight, too.\"\n\nGagnon is one of two sophomore goalies on the roster to go along with two seniors and a junior.\n\nHe's been able to answer the call at such a young age for the Redhawks so far this season and didn't get rattled on Saturday when the puck was bouncing around the crease in front of him.\n\nFor LaCouture Jr., the decision to start a sophomore in net wasn't a hard one - but one that wasn't taken lightly, either.\n\n\"He's just calm,\" said LaCouture Jr. of Gagnon. \"He's always under control. We've got five goalies that can go at anytime. But the thing I'm most proud of is that they all support each other. They're all cheering each other on, helping each other out and that's not easy because only one can play. Luc has improved an awful lot and gets stronger and stronger. I have confidence in all my goalies, I really do, but one thing being a new head coach going in, we've got 70 players in the system.\n\n\"So, we really took our time trying to evaluate everyone and not make any knee-jerk reactions, and we made sure everyone got a fair shake.\"\n\nWith the game scoreless in the third period, Natick went on the power play with 10:28 remaining.\n\nFollowing a shot from the point by senior David Drew that deflected off a Raiders defender, Genaske pounced on the loose puck and swatted a backhand shot past the glove of Hubbard for the 1-0 lead.\n\nThings got wild after that as the physicality ratcheted up and Natick was ultimately forced to kill off a five-minute major penalty and a 5-on-3 penalty-kill scenario, but the defense and Gagnon were up to the task and held on for the crucial conference win.\n\nWhile LaCouture Jr. has faith in all his goalies, and Gagnon in particular, the performance of the sophomore on Saturday could be something that sparks this team moving forward.\n\n\"Our guys just battled, and battled and battled, and Luc was a big part of that tonight,\" LaCouture Jr. said.\n\n\"This is two in a row, this is really big,\" Gagnon said. \"Just got to keep it rolling.\"",

                "body": "2020 Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden said the Bernie Sanders campaign \"flat out lied\" by posting videos that questioned the former vice president's record on Social Security. At Saturday's town hall event in Iowa, Biden called out the Sanders campaign for posting what he believes are \"doctored\" videos of him supporting cuts to Social Security.\n\n\"My stance on Social Security...Let's get the record straight: I'm not going to blame anybody, but...there's a little doctored video going around, put out by Bernie's people, saying that I agreed with Paul Ryan on wanting to privatize Social Security. It is simply a lie. That video that's going around...ask anybody in the press, it's a flat lie.\"\n\n- Joe Biden, former Vice President of the United States\n\nEarlier this month, a member of the Sanders campaign posted a series of videos of Biden from his time serving as a senator, where he appeared to advocate cutting Social Security spending.\n\nAlthough the videos do not seem to be edited, the former vice president insisted the clips were doctored. He added he wants the Sanders campaign to \"disown\" the videos.\n\nOfficials responded hours later, but not in the way Biden had hoped. The Sanders campaign manager stood by their decision to post the videos and stated, \"Joe Biden should be honest with voters.\"\n\nAt that same event, Biden mistakenly claimed a political fact-checking website had backed up his stance. In a newsletter sent to Bernie Sanders' supporters earlier this month, his campaign claimed \"in 2018, Biden lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare.\"\n\nThe website, PolitiFact, ultimately determined this statement was false and said Biden appeared to be mocking Ryan rather than praising him. However, they did not determine if the videos shared by the Sanders campaign were doctored, which disproved Biden's original claims from the town hall event.\n\n\"PolitiFact looked at it and they doctored the photo,\" said the former vice president. \"They doctored the piece and they have acknowledged it was a fake.\"\n\nIt appears Biden confused PolitiFact's analysis of the statement, made about him supporting Paul Ryan in the Sanders campaign newsletter, with the series of videos released by Sanders' staff.\n\nBiden and Sanders have been going head to head in the polls ahead of the Iowa caucus in February. The latest poll from RealClear Politics showed Biden with 20.7 percent and Sanders with 20.3 percent.",

No motels or movie theater, either. There also aren't any factories. Or roads.\n\nBut the first Americans to be counted in the 2020 census live in this tiny community of 661 on the edge of the American expanse. Their homes are huddled together in a windswept Bering Sea village, painted vivid lime green, purple or neon blue to help distinguish the signs of life from a frigid white winterscape that makes it hard to tell where the frozen sea ends and the village begins.\n\nFish drying racks hang outside some front doors, and you're more likely to find a snowmobile or four-wheeler in the driveway than a truck or SUV.\n\nIn this isolated outpost that looks little like other towns in the rest of the United States, the official attempt to count everyone living in the country will begin Tuesday.\n\nThe decennial U.S. census has started in rural Alaska, out of tradition and necessity, ever since the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867.\n\nOnce the spring thaw hits, the town empties as many residents scatter for traditional hunting and fishing grounds, and the frozen ground that in January makes it easier to get around by March turns to marsh that's difficult to traverse. The mail service is spotty and the internet connectivity unreliable, which makes door-to-door surveying important.\n\nFor those reasons, they have to start early here.\n\nThe rest of the country, plus urban areas of Alaska such as Anchorage, will begin the census in mid-March.\n\nSome of the biggest challenges to the count are especially difficult in Toksook Bay, one of a handful of villages on Nelson Island, which is about 500 miles (805 kilometers) west of Anchorage and only accessible by boat or plane.\n\nSome people speak only Alaska Native languages such as Yup'ik, or speak one language but don't read it.\n\nThe U.S. census provides questionnaires in 13 languages, and other guides, glossaries and materials in many more. But none is one of 20 official Alaska Native languages. So local groups are bringing together translators and language experts to translate the census wording and intent so local community leaders could trust, understand and relay the importance of the census.\n\nIt wasn't an easy task. Language can be very specific to a culture.\n\nFor example, there's no equivalent for \"apportionment\" -- the system used to determine representation in Congress -- in the language Denaakk'e, also known as Koyukon Athabascan. So translators used terms for divvying up moose meat in a village as an example for finding cultural relevancy, said Veri di Suvero, executive director of the agency partner Alaska Public Interest Research Group\n\nWhen the official count begins this week, the Census Bureau has hired four people to go door-to-door. At least two of them will be fluent in English and Yup'ik.\n\nPlaces such as Toksook Bay that run this risk of being under-counted also desperately need the federal funds assigned based on population for health care, education and general infrastructure.\n\nYet mistrust of the federal government is high. That's true in many parts of the U.S., but especially in Alaska, where many have strong libertarian views, and even more in a rural community where everyone knows everyone, and someone asking for personal information is seen with suspicion.\n\n\"The No. 1 barrier to getting an accurate count throughout Alaska is concern about privacy and confidentiality and an inherent distrust of the federal government,\" said Gabriel Layman, chairman of the Alaska Census Working Group. \"And that attitude is fairly pervasive in some of our more rural and remote communities.\"\n\nThe census is entirely confidential, Layman reassures people, and the Census Bureau can't give information to any law enforcement, immigration official to even to a landlord if you report if you have 14 people living in your rental. Violating that privacy could land a Census worker behind bars with a hefty fine.\n\nWhen the count begins on Tuesday, a Yup'ik elder who is part of a well-known Eskimo dancing group will be the first one counted.\n\nLizzie Chimiugak, whose age isn't known because records weren't kept but is anywhere from 89 to 93, is \"the grandma for the whole community,\" said Robert Pitka, the tribal administrator of the Nunakauyak Traditional Council in Toksook Bay.\n\nSteven Dillingham, the director of the U.S. Census Bureau, will be on hand for Tuesday's start.\n\nVillage officials will greet him at the town's airstrip and bring him to the school, where community members will bring traditional food, which could include seal, walrus, moose or musk ox. They'll have a ceremony with the dance group that includes Chimiugak, who will come to the school and dance in her wheelchair if the weather allows.\n\nMary Kailukiak, a town councilwoman, said she's one of the cooks.\n\n\"I'm thinking of maybe cooking up dried fish eggs, herring fish eggs,\" she said, pausing to speak to a reporter while ice fishing for tomcod and smolt on the Bering Sea, dressed in a black parka and snow pants and sporting a hat made by her daughter from sealskin and beaver. The eggs will be soaked overnight and served with seal oil.\n\nThen Dillingham will conduct the first official census count, or enumeration as it known, with Chimiugak, out of earshot of others to satisfy federal privacy laws.\n\nPitka is hoping for nice weather -- it's been as cold as -20 Fahrenheit (-29 Celsius) lately -- as the nation's eyes turn west for the event: \"It's going to be a very special moment.\"\n\nJoe Asuluk, 75, says it's important for people in Toksook Bay to be counted in the census.\n\nHe's lived in Toksook Bay since 1965, a year after it was founded, and pointed out local landmarks from the air to visitors on a recent flight from the hub community of Bethel, 115 miles (185 kilometers) away.\n\nAnd the fact the first count will be in his adopted hometown?\n\n\"We're pretty proud,\" he said, with his breath visible in the chill air, standing outside his small plane after landing, getting ready to get on a four-wheeler for the journey home.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

                "body": "A Pennsylvania man who kept his entire life savings in a Tupperware container is suing the federal government after the money - $82,373 in cash - was seized at an airport after DEA agents deemed it 'suspicious'.\n\nTerrence Rolin, 79, and his daughter Rebecca Brown are the lead plaintiffs in a federal class action lawsuit filed Wednesday by the Institute of Justice which accuses the Drug Enforcement Administration and Transportation Security Administration of 'treating American citizens like criminals' by seizing large amounts of cash from airline passengers without evidence of an underlying crime.\n\nBrown was visiting her father in Pittsburgh in August when he asked her to put his cash in a joint checking account.\n\nShe was flying back home to Boston to do that when TSA and DEA agents at Pittsburgh International Airport noticed the large sum of cash and began questioning her.\n\nBrown said she had checked the TSA website beforehand to confirm that she could fly with that amount of money, and the site didn't say that anything would prohibit her from doing so.\n\nA DEA agent asked Brown to put her father on the phone so he could verify her story about where the cash came from, but Rolin, who is suffering mental decline, was unable to verify some of the details, she said.\n\n'He just handed me the phone and said: \"Your stories don't match. We're seizing the cash,\"' Brown recalled.\n\nTerrence Rolin, 79, and his daughter Rebecca Brown (pictured together) are suing the DEA and TSA after Rolin's entire life savings - $82,373 - was seized at an airport in Pittsburgh last fall\n\nThe DEA notified Brown that it was seeking to permanently forfeit Rolin's life savings - leaving the retired railroad engineer unable to pay for dental work or repairs to his truck, his primary means of transportation.\n\n'My father and his parents worked hard for this money, and the government shouldn't be able to reach into his pocket and take it,' Brown said a press release announcing the lawsuit.\n\n'We did nothing wrong and haven't been charged with any crime, yet the DEA is trying to take my father's life savings. His savings should be returned right away, and the government should stop taking money from Americans who are doing something completely legal.'\n\n'We did nothing wrong and haven't been charged with any crime, yet the DEA is trying to take my father's life savings. His savings should be returned right away, and the government should stop taking money from Americans who are doing something completely legal,' Brown (pictured) said in a press release announcing the lawsuit\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Rolin, a retired railroad engineer, has been unable to pay for repairs to his truck or dental work after his money was seized by the federal government\n\nThe Institute of Justice, a Virginia-based public interest law firm, charges that Brown and Rolin's predicament is not uncommon as the DEA has a history of abusing a practice called civil asset forfeiture, which allows authorities to seize cash and property suspected of being connected to criminal activity, even if the owner is not charged with a crime.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the DEA's apparent policy of seizing money from travelers without probable cause when it exceeds $5,000 violates their Fourth Amendment rights.\n\n'You don't forfeit your constitutional rights when you try to board an airplane. It is time for TSA and federal law enforcement to stop seizing cash from travelers simply because the government considers certain amounts of cash \"suspicious,\"' Dan Alban, a senior attorney at the Institute of Justice, said in the press release.\n\n'We are trying to bring about institutional change and fix this terribly broken civil forfeiture system.'\n\nRolin and Brown are the lead plaintiffs in a federal class action lawsuit filed Wednesday by the Institute of Justice which accuses the Drug Enforcement Administration and Transportation Security Administration of 'treating American citizens like criminals' by seizing large amounts of cash from airline passengers without evidence of an underlying crime\n\nA 2016 investigation by USA Today found that the DEA had seized more than $209million from at least 5,200 travelers at 15 major airports across the previous decade.\n\nPolice groups have argued that civil forfeiture is a vital tool in disrupting drug trafficking by targeting its illicit proceeds.\n\nA 2017 report by the Justice Department Inspector General found that the DEA had seized more than $4billion in cash from individuals suspected of drug activity over the previous decade - but $3.2billion of those seizures never resulted in criminal charges.\n\nThe majority of the seizures were made at airports, train stations, and bus terminals, where DEA agents maintain a network of travel industry employees who act as confidential informants.\n\nThe DEA was reprimanded by the Justice Department in 2016 after the revelation that a TSA screener had been recruited as an informant and promised a cut of any forfeited cash he discovered.",

The BMC and police department will work together in order to ensure enough security is provided at such spots. Also, as it will be started on a pilot basis, we will assess the plan regularly.\"\n\nTourism minister Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday, in a meeting with municipal commissioner and commissioner of police, gave nod to the plan for gated communities - places that have CCTV surveillance, parking facilities, ensure safety of people and where noise is curtailed. Representatives of shopping malls, hotels and restaurants were also present at the meeting. HT had reported on Saturday that establishments willing to implement nightlife will have to inform the ward office, which will then coordinate with the police department.\n\nCivic chief Praveen Pardeshi had told HT that at least 25 malls and several other shops and restaurants can stay open throughout, however, the owner will decide on whether they want to keep it open 24x7. The owners can also decide which days they want to keep their establishments open around-the-clock -- some would prefer Friday to Sunday.\n\nActivist Nayana Kathpalia said, \"This is why we need a proper plan in place. Security at such places is a major concern, so is parking and traffic.\"",

                "body": "In an effort to counter plastic pollution, the Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay (IIT-B) has developed plastic-like films for the packaging industry that can degrade into harmless components.\n\nThe institute has developed a product that is a combination of non-toxic, edible sugar-based or fat-based biopolymers approved by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India that can degrade in about a week or a month.\n\nResearchers said at present high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is the standard non-degradable plastic barrier film, used for both consumer goods and food, by most packaging industries in India and overseas.\n\nThose making a switch to environment-friendly alternatives opt for sugarcane bagasse or starch containers or imported biodegradable barrier films made of polylactic acid (PLA).\n\nHDPE is made from petroleum which is a non-renewable source. The monomer for PLA is usually derived from renewable sources such as corn starch, tapioca roots or sugarcane, but is three times the cost of the standard HDPE films.\n\n\"Developing biodegradable alternatives to plastic is a major need since single-use plastic has become a global challenge in terms of environmental hazards,\" said Rinti Banerjee, Madhuri Sinha Chair Professor, department of biosciences and bioengineering.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Environment Programme, plastics take more than century to degrade in the environment.\n\nGlobally, 50% of consumer plastics are designed to be used only once, and 10% plastic waste is generated via domestic consumption. Only 9% of all plastic ever produced is being recycled.\n\nDescribing their work as a conscious spin-off, Banerjee said, \"We have been developing non-toxic materials and technologies for various medical applications that have to degrade in the body, and therefore felt our knowledge of biomaterials can address the need of biodegradable alternatives to plastic that can be degraded completely and are also suitable for reuse.\"\n\nFor the last two years, they have developed different kinds of primary film-based plastic packaging that can degrade from a week to a month. The plastic film's transition from being transparent to translucent based on the composition of the polymers.\n\nThe low-cost invention comprises films three times the tensile strength of the HDPE films and six times that of PLA films . This is nearly one-third the cost of PLA films, said Banerjee.\n\nA patent for technology development and composition of the biodegradable material has been filed and at present, the technology is being scaled up.\n\nScaling up of the manufacture of the biodegradable films with a Chennai-based packaging company is underway.\n\nIn its first phase, the product will focus on primary packaging of fast-moving consumer goods, which will then extend to packing solid perishables such as fruits and vegetables, and finally for liquids such as pouches of milk and juices.\n\n\"We need to have alternatives to plastics, especially single-use plastic. The alternatives should be sustainable, using natural materials and those which produce natural intermediates upon degradation\" said Anjali Parasnis, associate director, western regional centre, The Energy Resource Institute, who is not involved with the work.",

Honesty. As to competence, it is assumed that you're competent because it is your job,\" Panelo said over dzIQ.\n\nPanelo made the remarks a few days after Duterte announced his decision to appoint Gamboa, the PNP officer in charge, as the country's top cop.\n\nGamboa's appointment was made known on Friday night.\n\nAt a gathering of The Fraternal Order of Eagles in Davao City that included Gamboa among the guests, the President announced that he was impressed with Gamboa's honesty.\n\nHowever, the Chief Executive said he would have a \"long, long, long talk\" with Gamboa and Interior Secretary Eduardo A\u00f1o first to ensure that there would be no mistakes.\n\nThe announcement ended three months of speculation as to who will succeed ex-PNP chief Gen. Oscar Albayalde, who resigned on Oct. 14, 2019 at the height of the \"ninja cops\" scandal.\n\nGamboa, like his predecessor, is a member of the PNP's Sinagtala Class of 1986.\n\nHe served as spokesperson of the Davao regional police office from 1997 to 2002 when Mr. Duterte was still Davao City mayor.\n\nGamboa, who is also the PNP's deputy chief for administration, was named as PNP officer in charge immediately upon Albayalde's resignation last October.",

She was referring to the black and white Narendra Kumar Ahmed-designed bespoke jacket that the charismatic information technology (IT) tycoon had chosen to wear on his visit. Interestingly, both Ahmed and Soni share an association with Amazon, the Bezos-founded conglomerate that currently dominates the planet. Soni had been roped in to design the first precious jewellery collection for Amazon in India, and Ahmed heads the company's fashion and lifestyle division here. \"Nari had been roped in to do the fittings for Bezos,\" says Soni about the jacket, adding, \"I know this because his partner Kadambari is one of my closest friends, so I was in the loop, she said. \"I was thrilled to see that it was the same piece I had purchased. It's beautiful, and I wore it for the recent Sotheby's auction and received so many compliments,\" she said.\n\nWhen the world's leading online retail site had launched its operations in India, Soni had designed a fine jewellery collection for its site in the range of \u20b91 lakh and she says she did a pair of earrings conceptualised in clean lines, with tiny diamond studs and detachable rose gold dangling balls.\n\nHow many people can boast of wearing the same jacket as the world's richest man? \"The only variation is that mine is black, white and gold, while the one Bezos chose is black and white,\" said Soni.\n\nThe chatterati cannot get over the recent revelation that one of India Inc's leading statesmen not only turned down the opportunity of receiving a lifetime achievement award from no less than the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace in order to tend to one of his beloved pet pooches who was ailing, but that he called this Delhi-based marketing guru no less than 11 times to convey his apologies about the same. This delicious nugget of information was conveyed to the general public by none else than the marketing guru in an expensively-shot video interview, where it appears that the sole purpose of the exchange was to convey the guru's proximity to the statesman.\n\nEleven calls? As far as image building and marketing of one's importance is concerned that surely is worth a hell of a lot of moolah and credibility.\n\nIncidentally, the marketing guru who was rumoured to have been out favour ever since his embroilment in the recent #MeToo scandal, is said to be back in favour again with the India Inc leader, perhaps after the latter's recent embroilment in an unrelated scandal.\n\n\"India mein depression concept hee kahan hota hai (Who understands depression in India)? Nobody knows about it and in Meerut, certainly not. I had no one to talk to, felt almost constant chid-chidapan (irritation).\n\n-Former Indian fast bowler Praveen Kumar on his tryst with depression recently\n\nTo Krishna ji, with love\n\nWe cannot be more thrilled about the launch of Jairam Ramesh's 'A Chequered Brilliance: The Many Lives of VK Krishna Menon' this evening in Mumbai. After all, the towering intellectual, politician and close aide of Jawaharlal Lal Nehru, widely believed to be the second-most powerful man in India of his time, had been a close friend of the family, someone who'd been present at the hospital on the day we had been born!\n\nKrishnaji, as we fondly referred to the acerbic and towering intellect, had been a leitmotif of our growing years, a man deeply admired and loved by our parents for his brilliance and warmth. A product of Chennai's Presidency College, and later the London School of Economics (where Harold Laski is said to have described him as the best student he ever had), Menon had been a controversial figure, one who had been as vilified as he had been admired. As India's defence minister, he had laid the foundation for its relations with neighbours such as China, and as a diplomat, he is said to have been the architect of India's foreign policy in the sixties and the seventies.\n\nBut for us, Menon had been a familiar figure, a tall and handsome intellectual whose visits to our home had been frequent, and whose love for children much celebrated. My parents, along with the likes of barrister Rajni Patel, film stars Dilip Kumar and Sunil Dutt, and professionals such as Dr Borges, had rallied to Menon's side when he'd fought and won as a candidate for North Bombay in two hotly contested Lok Sabha elections. We had been barely a few years old then, but we still recall the ideological fervour that his candidacy had invoked. Later, he had gone on to stand from other constituencies in Bengal and Kerala, but his campaign in Mumbai was forever etched in the city's discourse.\n\nIncidentally, with his proximity to Nehruvian principles, his Keralite background, his performance at the United Nations, and his contribution to the world of literature and letters - could there be any more similarities to a certain Mr Shashi Tharoor?\n\nPerhaps Tharoor is just the Menon of this Gen. And you only have to know of our regard for the late statesman to understand what a compliment that is!",

The action-packed, buddy comedy returned for the franchise's third installment after a 17-year hiatus with popular demand to outlast \"Dolittle,\" starring Robert Downey Jr., which opened at second with a mediocre $22.5 million.\n\nSony Pictures predicted that \"Bad Boys\" will make around $68 million over the four-day weekend. The film exceeded expectations, building momentum with favorable reviews including an A Cinema Score and a 76% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\"It's a great brand with two terrific stars, a beloved franchise and it feels like summertime in January,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. He said it was a smart move by Sony Pictures to release the film during January, an unusual month for blockbusters releases but it ultimately \"reaped huge benefits.\"\n\n\"Dolittle\" barely topped the World War I film \"1917,\" which claimed the top spot last week. The Sam Mendes-directed war film continues to hold strong with $22.1 million this weekend after going from 11 screens in its first weeks to more than 3,600.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated epic wartime film has gained popularity after it won Golden Globes for best director and drama film a couple weeks ago. Saturday night, it won an award for theatrical motion picture at the Producers Guild Awards, which has gone on to win best picture Oscar 21 out of 30 times, including the past two years.\n\n\"'1917' is really taking a lot of the oxygen and taking on a life of its own since the Oscar nominations and all of these awards,\" Dergarabedian said. \"If you haven't seen '1917,' you're totally out of the loop for awards season.\"\n\nAlong with \"Bad Boys,\" Sony Pictures has two other films in the top 10 at the domestic box office including Oscar-contender \"Little Women\" and \"Jumanji: The Next Level,\" which crossed $700 million worldwide.\n\nIn another blockbuster, \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" topped $1 billion globally after five weeks. The Disney's film focusing on the final chapter of the Luke Skywalker saga has also earned more than $492 million domestically.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. \"Bad Boys for Life,\" $59.1 million.\n\n2. \"Dolittle,\" $22.5 million.\n\n3. \"1917,\" $22.1 million.\n\n4. \"Jumanji: The Next Level,\" $9.5 million.\n\n5. \"Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker,\" $8.3 million.\n\n6. \"Just Mercy,\" $6 million.\n\n7. \"Little Women,\" $5.9 million.\n\n8. \"Knives Out,\" $4.3 million.\n\n9. \"Like A Boss,\" $3.8 million.\n\n10. \"Frozen 2,\" $3.7 million.\n\n-- -- --\n\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Jonathan Landrum Jr. on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/MrLandrum31\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Mohammed Nazim Rehman, a resident of Colaba, was arrested by the Colaba police on July 14, 2015, when the said incident took place. Rehman runs a cutlery shop.\n\nAs per the girl's parent's complaint on July 6, 2015, the accused approached the girl and asked her phone number. Because of this she got scared and disturbed. The accused approached the girl again on July 14, 2015, when the teen was headed home from her tuition classes along with a friend. This time, the accused allegedly took her phone number from her friend. The girl got scared again and called her parents who reached the spot after some time.\n\nThe accused, along with other boys who were at the spot, fled after the girl's parents reached there. The boys entered a hotel and subsequently were caught by the police who arrived there on the parent's phone call. Only Rehman was arrested while other boys were allowed to go.\n\nRehman was charged with sections 354D (stalking) of Indian Penal Code and 12 (sexual harassment) of the Pocso Act.\n\nThe witnesses and the prosecution presented in the court failed to substantiate the findings of the police investigation.\n\nIn the cross-examination of the girl, she clearly admitted that she was not certain whether the accused shown to her (by the police and the parents) is the same person.\n\nAdvocate Sunil Pandey representing the accused stated that allegations were not made out against the accused and also there was no sexual intent in the matter.

                "title": "Movie Review - The Sonata (2020)",
                "body": "Directed by Andrew Desmond.\n\nStarring Freya Tingley, Simon Abkarian, James Faulkner, Rutger Hauer, Catherine Schaub-Abkarian, and Matt Barber.\n\nA young violinist unravels her long lost father's past, triggering dark forces that reach beyond her imagination.\n\nMusic and horror belong forever entangled in a delicate dance that ends in pure unbridled evil. Take The Sonata. Something so bone-chilling, beautiful, and packed with Baroquian sophistication built on classic orchestral scores. Our ears hear violins weeping which brings upon this somber lulling sensation, only to have Andrew Desmond's terrorization emerge from behind sheet music stands. I think of films like Grand Piano or Deathgasm, two vastly varying subgenre types yet both made stronger by the instrumental elements at hand. Desmond achieves the same kind of enchanting rhythm while his \"sonata of the damned\" echoes through castle walls, as audibly pleasing as it is effectively spooky.\n\nRecording prodigy Rose Fisher (Freya Tingley) has just inherited her father's estate after his untimely death. Richard Marlowe (Rutger Hauer), said to be the savior of British classical composition in the 80s, spent the rest of his life toiling away in isolation instead of becoming the phenom so many predicted. That's all Rose knows of her notorious parent, who abandoned her after only fourteen months. Rose arrives in France with intentions of getting the remnants of a once-great musician in order, but finds an unpublished sonata that calls to her. Could Marlowe's last collection of notes be the break she, and her agent Charles (Simon Abkarian), need? The piece's illustrious connection to Marlowe would spark enough intrigue itself, if they can decipher the strange symbols marking each bar.\n\nIt's with sadness that The Sonata presents one of Rutger Hauer's final posthumous performances, as he plays a reclusive orchestral genius who keeps referencing \"voices\" behind his work. An introductory first-person sequence, recorded interviews, and scant \"from the dead\" vision are enough to showcase Hauer's ability to make the most of little time. A veteran who's there to deliver a few under-your-skin quotes, upping the levels of dread through tonal gruffness. For the amount Hauer is asked of, it's a somber farewell befitting a tortured role.\n\nThe Sonata is all about atmosphere and tone and unease. As Rose returns \"home,\" she's haunted by ghosts of her past in forms both expected and unknown. It's a familiar setup that Andrew Desmond works into a softly condemning sense of trouble, which works to the film's favor. There's the faithful housekeeper who drops in for a scare, creepy artwork hanging on the walls, locked toolsheds with predictably unsafe secrets - the works. Desmond isn't rewriting horror history, but his sleuthy and haunting narrative continually incants a most alarming chorus. Yes, this is a phrase of approval.\n\nFreya Tingley takes her leading character - a workhorse, willful soloist with a penchant for success driven by ego - and runs with Desmond's tortured caretaker arc. Simon Abkarian's inclusion is mostly of a \"friend\" who becomes obsessed with possibilities of stardom, complementing Tingley's stronger attributes by pushing into known realms of dangerous performance art. Be it impressing via string-plucky showmanship, making herself a known commodity while burying her father's name, or encountering the horrors that await. Tingley shines as a standout who can play both shaken and empowered, as The Sonata unravels with each translated scribble on Marlowe's page.\n\nThat's the key here. The Sonata is not just about sheet music that can summon the antichrist. A larger story about cultism is supported by Desmond's ability to spin gothic folklore that flourishes within its own capabilities. Do I wish there was more practicality when it comes to special effects and reveals? Of course. Does that tank a product otherwise well within its rights to disturb and offer finely-tuned sounds of exquisite tension? Not in the least. With a meager budget and discernably elegant horror ideas, Desmond works to assure fans have many a lingering number of highs to appreciate.\n\nWe're only half a month into 2020 and already I'm being presented \"under the radar\" horror titles not to be missed. The Sonata is dreary, isolated despicableness set to a whimsically infiltrating score. I love being able to say we already have a \"don't ignore\" genre title this year, so early, and I urge you to seek out Andrew Desmond's latest if you're into character pieces fit around a satanic goose chase with doomsday implications. Tightly wound, suspenseful horror that does exactly what's promised and leaves you wanting more, but still aptly satiated. A film that examines the music industry and \"catching your break\" while also handling themes of grief, trauma, and hereditary fate. Oh, and it's approvably creeptacular in slow-burn but sinister ways? Press play, friends.\n\nFlickering Myth Rating - Film: \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \/ Movie: \u2605 \u2605 \u2605",

                "title": "US agency investigating 'self-accelerating' Tesla cars",
                "body": "DETROIT (AP) -- The U.S. government's auto safety agency is looking into allegations that all three of Tesla's electric vehicle models can suddenly accelerate on their own.\n\nBrian Sparks of Berkeley, California, petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asking for an investigation. An agency document shows 127 owner complaints to the government that include 110 crashes and 52 injuries. The agency said it will look into allegations that cover about 500,000 Tesla vehicles including Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles from the 2013 through 2019 model years.\n\nThe agency's investigations office will evaluate the petition and decide if it should open a formal probe. \"I am concerned that these complaints reflect a systemic defect that has not been investigated by NHTSA,\" Sparks wrote to James Owens, the acting NHTSA administrator. \"I am also concerned that these potential defects represent risk to the safety of Tesla drivers, their passengers, and the public.\"\n\nMessages were left Friday seeking comment from Tesla.NHTSA is already investigating three December crashes involving Tesla vehicles in which three people were killed.\n\nThe agency's special crash investigations unit sent teams to Gardena, California, and near Terre Haute, Indiana, to probe two fatal crashes. Another crash in Connecticut also is under investigation.\n\nFrank Borris, a former head of safety defect investigations for NHTSA, said the number of complaints cited in the petition is unusual and warrants further investigation. \"The sheer number of complaints would certainly catch my eye,\" said Borris, who now runs an auto safety consulting business.\n\nTesla owners communicate with other owners on Internet forums and social media, and that could influence the number of complaints, he said. He said the timing of the petition is good, because the agency needs to do a \"deeper dive\" into Tesla safety.\n\nSome of the unintended acceleration complaints, which have yet to be verified by NHTSA, allege that the cars' electronics malfunctioned. In his 69-page petition, Sparks analyzed the complaints to NHTSA and determined that many of the crashes happened while drivers were parking the Teslas. He compared Tesla's unintended acceleration complaint rate to other vehicles and found Tesla's to be much higher. Many of the reports, Sparks wrote, show that Tesla has refused to share data with vehicle owners after an unintended acceleration incident. \"It is clear that Tesla has the data and is aware of the problem,\" Sparks wrote.\n\nIn one complaint, an owner in San Clemente, California, told NHTSA that in November of 2018, a Model X SUV accelerated on its own to full power during a U-Turn on a city street. The driver had a foot on the brake, but the SUV accelerated in a fraction of a second, according to the complaint. The driver alleged that something in Tesla's system \"triggered the sudden spontaneously full acceleration, resulting in this collision.\"\n\nThe SUV hit a parked vehicle, the air bags inflated and the owner had a large abdominal bruise and several small chest bruises, according to the complaint. People who file complaints with NHTSA are not identified in the agency's database.\n\nThe driver asked NHTSA to find out whether the Tesla complaints had common elements, including parking or making turns at low speeds. In another crash, in May of 2013, the owner of a Model S sedan in Thousand Oaks, California, complained that while pulling into a parking spot, the car suddenly accelerated on its own.\n\nThe Model S went over a parking block and a curb and struck a cement light post. The air bags inflated, but no one was hurt, the complaint said.\n\nThree weeks after the crash, the owner got a letter from Tesla saying that the accelerator was depressed to 48% just before the crash and 98% at the time of impact. The owner still believes the car accelerated by itself, the complaint stated.\n\nAnyone can petition NHTSA to investigate an auto safety problem, and the agency said in a statement Friday that it encourages people to report concerns.\n\nIn the other Tesla crashes that NHTSA is investigating, authorities are trying to determine whether the cars were operating on Autopilot, a system designed to keep a car in its lane and a safe distance from other vehicles. Autopilot also can change lanes on its own. Separately, the National Transportation Safety Board will hold a hearing Feb. 25 on a fatal crash in Mountain View, California, involving a Tesla that was operating on the company's Autopilot driver assist system.\n\nTesla has said repeatedly that its Autopilot system is designed only to assist drivers, who must still pay attention and be ready to intervene at all times. The company contends that Teslas with Autopilot are safer than vehicles without it, but cautions that the system does not prevent all crashes.NHTSA's crash program has inspected 23 crashes involving vehicles that the agency believed were operating on some form of partially automated advanced driver assist system. Fourteen of these cases involved Tesla models. The team investigates more than 100 crashes per year.",

His previous full-year pay was Sh24.1 million.\n\n\"The salary for the executive director is set at a level which is considered appropriate to attract an individual with the necessary experience and ability to oversee the business,\" Sasini says in the report.\n\nThe salary is subject to annual review in October of each year based on internal and external factors such as responsibilities, market positioning, inflation and company performance.\n\nOther benefits enjoyed by a CEO include medical cover, pension, club membership as well as travel and other expenses incurred in the course of performing duties.\n\nSasini's policy is to appoint a CEO for an initial two-year period, which may be extended for a further term by mutual consent.\n\nThe initial appointments and any subsequent reappointments are subject to annual review by its remuneration and nomination committee.\n\nDuring the period, the firm paid Sh8.55 million in fees and sitting allowances to its eight non-executive directors. This was up from the Sh7.89 million paid out in the previous period.\n\nThe increased earnings for the executive and non-executive directors was despite the company's drop in performance. Sasini sunk into a net loss of Sh337.7 million on the back of lower sales from dropping tea and coffee prices.\n\nThe Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm had made a net profit of Sh293.5 million the year before.",

In a recent circular, the state education department has released a tentative schedule for the admissions.\n\nAs per a tentative schedule issued by the department, the portal for the application would stay open from February 11 to February 29, 2020. Admissions for students who are waitlisted will be conducted between April 13 and May 22.\n\n\"There will be a single lottery this time for which all the interested students will be able to apply. Those who are allotted seats can confirm their admissions in the respective schools as per the schedule. The remaining students would be waitlisted depending on the vacancies available in schools,\" reads the circular.\n\nLike last year, parents who have been allotted schools would have to get their documents verified from a committee formed by the education department. With nearly 39,000 seats lying vacant under the quota last year, the education department had to announce an additional round after four regular rounds last year. Of these, 4000 vacant seats were from schools in Mumbai.\n\nActivists said that the government should ensure that all the vacant seats are filled. \"Whether they take one round or more, they have to ensure that seats do not remain vacant when there are several students who fail to get allotments. We also want to ask the government to do away with the scrutinising committee, as it is yet another hurdle in parents getting admissions,\" said Sudhir Paranjape, a city-based RTE activist.",

                "body": "Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley first realised something odd was happening to her hair back in the fall of 2019.\n\n\"I had been waking up every morning to sinkfuls of hair, \" the freshmen Democrat from Massachusetts told The Root.\n\nShe was dealing with the tell-tale signs of alopecia areata, a disease in which the body attacks its own hair follicles, prompting hair loss.\n\nBy the time President Trump was impeached in December, all of her hair was gone.\n\n\"Impeachment eve, the last little bit of my hair came out,\" she said. \"I was completely bald.\"\n\nShe has kept up her coiffed appearance since then by quietly wearing wigs until last Thursday, when she went public by showing off her smooth bald head in a 7-minute video posted on The Root.\n\nOn Sunday, Pressley also posted her first bald selfie on Twitter.\n\nHer colleague, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded quickly in support of the wig-free look.\n\n\"Ayanna leads the fight for justice and does it all walking backwards, in heels, with a matching lip AND makes space for others rocking a hat better than anyone you know. A queen,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\n\nThe hair-free look is a dramatic change from Pressley's previous Senegalese twists, which she said she first started wearing about five years ago. Those long, rope-like tresses made her feel like she'd \"met\" herself \"fully for the first time,\" she said.\n\nPressley is the first black congresswoman from Massachusetts, and she said it has become hard for her to separate her hair from her political identity.\n\n\"My twists have become such a synonymous and conflated part of - not only my personal identity and how I show up in the world - but my political brand,\" Pressley said in the video. \"We receive letters from all over the globe of women who talk about their own emancipation, that they feel that I've given them permission [to do their hair differently].\"\n\nPressley said she's still \"making peace\" with having alopecia, but added she also doesn't feel like herself when she wears wigs.\n\n\"People are well-meaning, and have been reminding me of the India Arie song, you know, 'I am not my hair,' she said. \"You are not your hair, and that's true. But I still want it!\"\n\nAlopecia areata is a condition that can crop up in women and men, both old and young. The National Alopecia Areata Foundation estimates that as many as 6.8 million people in the US have it.One 2019 study suggests the condition may be more common among African-Americans than other ethnic groups.\n\nThere's no cure for the baldness, but there are some treatments like Rogaine that try to stimulate hair follicles (they don't work for everybody, though). Sometimes a person's hair grows back on its own.\n\n\"In its most common form, alopecia areata causes small round or oval patches of baldness on the scalp,\" according to Harvard Health. \"The area of bald skin looks smooth and normal.\"\n\nMost people with alopecia are otherwise healthy, though some also develop brittle, ridgy, dented, or red nails.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, hairstyles that \"pull your hair tight\" can cause what's called \"traction alopecia,\" and hot oil treatments and perms can inflame hair follicles, and eventually lead to hair loss.",

He ended up tied for 25th in the Luisita Championship, shared 19th place at Southwoods, tied for eighth at Aboitiz, wound up joint 10th at the CAT Open before finishing fifth at Summit Point.\n\nBut he hopes to flash his old magic this week although he remains wary of the opposition, particularly the other local aces who are all coming into the 72-hole championship raring to foil his bid for a record run in the third season (2019-2020) of the circuit put up by ICTSI.\n\nFront-runner Tony Lascu\u00f1a, for one, is also out to press his bid for the Order of Merit crown while Clyde Mondilla is, likewise, priming up for his defense of the Philippine Open crown.\n\n2018 PGT OOM winner Jobim Carlos also vows to come out strong in a bid to end a string of so-so finishes following a dip in form last year, along with veterans Jay Bayron, Elmer Salvador, Jerson Balasabas, Michael Bibat, Rufino Bayron and Gerald Rosales.\n\nThe young guns are also tipped to crowd the fancied bets in all four days of the event organized by Pilipinas Golf Tournaments Inc. and backed by by PLDT Enterprise, Meralco, BDO and PGT Asia official apparel Pin High, with Ira Alido due for a big win after a string of impressive finishes last year.\n\nOthers expected to contend are Reymon Jaraula, Keanu Jahns, James Ryan Lam, Justin Quiban, Nilo Salahog, Sean Talmadge, Rupert Zaragosa and former amateur hotshot Lloyd Go.",

Adam Schiff said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" Schiff was selected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as the lead impeachment manager for Trump's Senate trial.\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., contended that the National Security Agency \"in particular is withholding what are potentially relevant documents to our oversight responsibilities on Ukraine, but also withholding documents potentially relevant that the senators might want to see during the trial. That is deeply concerning.\" He also said \"there are signs that the CIA may be on the same tragic course.\"\n\nThe NSA and CIA did not immediately respond to a requests for comment.\n\nTrump's impeachment trial resumes Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats have previously criticized the State Department for withholding relevant documents to the impeachment inquiry. In the weeks since Trump was impeached, Democrats have sought to focus on new evidence about Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals and are pushing the Senate to consider new documents and testimony, such as from former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nDuring the ABC interview, Schiff was asked about a Politico report that said intelligence officials were pushing the House and Senate Intelligence committees to drop the public portion of an annual briefing on world security threats following last year's session in which Trump lashed out over the assessments on North Korea, Iran and the Islamic State.\n\nThe request was reportedly being made in a bid to avoid a repeat in which intelligence officials might publicly disagree with Trump on the security risks.\n\n\"Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!\" Trump tweeted after that Jan. 29 hearing, before abruptly reversing course and saying he and the intelligence community \"are all on the same page.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Schiff described the news reports as \"all too accurate.\"\n\n\"The intelligence community is reluctant to have an open hearing, something that we had done every year prior to the Trump administration, because they're worried about angering the president,\" he said.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Associated Press.

                "body": "Three men linked to white supremacists and planning to attend were arrested\n\nA gun-rights rally in Virginia is expected to draw a mix of militias, firearms advocates and white supremacists to Richmond on Monday as the state's capital remained on high alert Sunday.\n\nMany residents in the city are said to fear a repeat of violence seen in nearby Charlottesville in 2017 after state officials and hate-monitoring groups warned about the potential for violence.\n\nCiting credible threats, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a temporary state of emergency, banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square.\n\nVirginia's solicitor general last week also said law enforcement had identified 'credible evidence' armed out-of-state groups planned to come to Virginia with the possible intention of participating in a 'violent insurrection.'\n\nOnline, threats of violence have been 'rampant' among anti-government and far-right groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white supremacists and other extremists. Conspiracy theories and other misinformation have also proliferated.\n\nAnd organizers of an annual vigil at the Capitol for the victims of gun violence said Friday they have canceled their event this year because of fears of 'armed insurrectionists.'\n\nBarriers are set up at the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond on Saturday. An unprecedented show of force by gun-rights activists is expected on Monday in Virginia. They are angry over the state's plans to enact a slew of gun restrictions\n\nThe Virginia state Capitol building is surrounded by fencing on Thursday. Gov. Ralph Northam on Wednesday announced a state of emergency and banned all weapons from the rally\n\nBut several militia leaders with large followings on social media, who attended the Charlottesville rally, said they were coming purely to show their support for those opposed to new, more restrictive gun laws in the state.\n\n'If you think that we're a threat coming into your city, then you don't know who we are, you don't understand what we're about,' said Joshua Shoaff, who has over 542,000 Facebook followers and goes by the pseudonym Ace Baker. 'We're not anarchists - we believe in government.'\n\nSo who is expected to turn up to the rally on Monday?\n\nVirginia Citizens Defense League\n\nThe rally, aimed at showing gun enthusiasts' disdain for swift moves the newly Democrat-controlled legislature is making to pass stiffer gun laws, has been organized by the Virginia Citizens Defense League.\n\nA pro-gun rights group that annually comes out in force to lobby Virginia's legislature to not pass any new gun laws, they are said to be working closely with police in an effort to pull off a smooth event.\n\nBut they have called for tens of thousands of armed citizens to come to the event, hiking tensions.\n\nThe VCDL, an influential grassroots gun-rights organization, has donated over $200,000 to state lawmakers since 2002, records show. The group has emphasized the rally is intended to be peaceful and urged members not to bring long guns, saying they would be a 'distraction.'\n\nThe Virginia Citizens Defense League, an influential grassroots gun-rights organization with a long record in the state, has been the leading force behind Monday's rally\n\nWhite nationalists, neo-Nazis and members of the 'alt-right' clash with counter-protesters during the 'Unite the Right' rally August 12, 2017 in Charlottesville\n\n'The eyes of the nation and the world are on Virginia and VCDL right now and we must show them that gun owners are not the problem,'the group wrote in a recent email to its members.\n\nThe group's president, Philip Van Cleave, has been in the national spotlight before. In 2018, Van Cleave was duped into participating in Sacha Baron Cohen's ambush chat show, where he advocated for arming children.\n\nGun Owners of America\n\nThe influential pro-gun group Gun Owners of America describes itself as the only 'no-compromise' gun lobby in Washington and enjoys a loyal following.\n\nFounded in 1975 by a California state lawmaker, Gun Owners of America joined the VCDL to seek an injunction against enforcement of Gov. Ralph Northam's executive order banning gun from the Capitol Square.\n\nOn its website, the group has urged its members to attend Monday's rally.\n\nThe influential pro-gun group Gun Owners of America describes itself as the only 'no-compromise' gun lobby in Washington and enjoys a loyal following\n\nNRA\n\nThe National Rifle Association, the country's best known gun-rights organization, has distanced itself from Monday's rally and instead held a lobby day last week.\n\nHundreds of people attended the event, where the NRA handed out unloaded 30-round gun magazines. A spokeswoman for the group headquartered in northern Virginia said the magazines were meant as a 'morale booster' for the NRA members who showed up to urge lawmakers to reject the gun control measures proposed by Northam and Democratic lawmakers.\n\nOath Keepers\n\nFormer U.S. Army paratrooper Stewart Rhodes formed The Oath Keepers in 2009, and the group has become one of the nation's largest anti-government organizations, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nIn 2014, Oath Keeper members joined an armed standoff between federal officials and Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy over grazing rights on government land.\n\nThe group urged its members in a post on its website to attend Monday's rally\n\nLater that year and in 2015, members patrolled the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, amid protests over the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown. They wore camouflage body armor and openly carried rifles.\n\nThe group urged its members in a post on its website to attend Monday's rally and said it was sending trainers to Virginia to organize and train 'armed posses and militia.'\n\n'It is NOT just about one day at a rally. It's about organizing and training up Virginians in each town and county to make their Second Amendment Sanctuary Counties truly strong, united, and capable of actually defending their lives, liberty, and property,' the group's website says.\n\nThe Oath Keepers has become one of the nation's largest anti-government organizations\n\nAn Oath Keeper, brought on to provide security, stands guard during a pro-Donald Trump rally at Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park in Berkeley, California on April 27, 2017\n\nThe Oath Keepers protest proposed local and federal gun control legislation in Minnesota\n\nThree Percenter Movement\n\nThe Three Percenters are a loosely organized movement that formed in 2008, according to the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish civil rights organization that tracks extremist groups.\n\nOn its website, the right-wing group says it isn't an anti-government militia but 'we will defend ourselves when necessary.'\n\nMembers of the AAF III% militia at the Pro-Freedom rally at the Indiana Statehouse during the during the third day of the National Rifle Association convention being held nearby in April\n\nA member of the AAF III% militia folds the American flag after the Pro-Freedom rally at the Indiana Statehouse during the during the third day of the National Rifle Association convention being held nearby in April last year\n\nThe Three Percenters derives its name from the belief that just 3% of the colonists rose up to fight the British. They have vowed to resist any government that infringes on the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe Oregon Three Percenters joined an armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Dozens of people occupied the remote refuge for more than a month to protest federal control of Western lands. The group also took part in a violent right-wing rally in Portland last year.\n\nWhite supremacists\n\nJ.J. MacNab, a fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said she didn't expect large numbers of white supremacists. But MacNab said she thinks those who do attend will try to capitalize on the large expected crowd for a moment in the limelight.\n\n'It's going to be a big event -- they want to be part of it. They're desperate to do Charlottesville 2.0,' she said, referring to the 2017 rally that descended into violence.\n\nEarlier this week, authorities arrested six men they linked to a violent white supremacist group known as The Base. At least three of the men were planning to attend the rally in Richmond according to an official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an active investigation.\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan protests on July 8, 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia. The KKK was protesting the planned removal of a statue of General Robert E. Lee, and calling for the protection of Southern Confederate monuments\n\nOther leaders of well-known militias also vowed they were not seeking confrontations in Richmond. But police warned that among those they know to be attending are known neo-Nazis and other groups who may seek to hijack the gun-rights gathering.\n\nThe Virginia Senate late on Thursday passed bills to require background checks on all firearms sales, limit handgun purchases to one a month, and restore local governments' right to ban weapons from public buildings and other venues.\n\nBoth Virginia legislative houses are also expected to pass 'red flag' laws that would allow courts and local law enforcement to remove guns from people deemed a risk to communities, among other measures.\n\nThe FBI said it arrested three men linked to a violent white supremacist group Thursday who were planning to attend the rally in Richmond, according to a law enforcement official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an active investigation.\n\nLuke Austin, left, Jacob Kaderli, center, and Michael Helterbrand have all been arrested . They have links to a violent white supremacist group, according to police\n\nBarriers are set up at the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond on Saturday\n\n'Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia,' Trump wrote in the post, adding: 'That's what happens when you vote for Democrats'\n\nPresident Donald Trump backed the rally organizers in a Twitter post on Friday in which he said the U.S. Constitution was under attack by recent gun control measures in Virginia, a state that Hilary Clinton won in 2016 and where Democrats took full control of the state legislature for the first time in a generation in November.\n\n'Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia,' Trump wrote in the post, referring to the amendment in the Bill of Rights that gives Americans the right to keep and bear firearms. 'That's what happens when you vote for Democrats, they will take your guns away.'\n\nTodd Gilbert, the Republican leader in Virginia's House of Delegates, said in a statement on Saturday that violence was not welcome during Monday's rally.\n\n'Any group that comes to Richmond to spread white supremacist garbage, or any other form of hate, violence, or civil unrest isn't welcome here,' he said. 'While we and our Democratic colleagues may have differences, we are all Virginians and we will stand united in opposition to any threats of violence or civil unrest from any quarter.'",

A new decade even, as you might've heard.\n\nThis is Drake Baer, writing in lieu of executive editor Matt Turner, who's on parental leave. I run the strategy desk at Business Insider, where we cover how the professional world is shifting and how to navigate it. We have a vested interest in reinvention, one that you can follow through our weekly newsletter, Success Insider. And if you're interested in renewables, check out Power Line - our just-launched newsletter covering clean energy.\n\nOver the past week, the Business Insider newsroom has had a variety of pieces that will help you plan out the year, and maybe the decade. Perhaps you want to finally get going in real estate, or you're curious about cannabis, or you keep hearing about the social reselling platforms where the kids are getting all their fashion.

We'll show you how.\n\nHere's a look at how SoftBank's dot-com-era investments played out - half of these 14 startups it bet on collapsed\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate SoftBank quickly went from being lauded to scrutinised with the fallout of WeWork. But as our reporters uncovered, the house that Masayoshi Son built (like many investors) has a history of calamity. The first megafund, SoftBank Capital Partners, surfed on the dot-com boom at the turn of the last century - and a frankly shocking number of those would-be world-beaters went belly up.\n\nA Silicon Valley tech leader left behind a lucrative career to pursue real-estate investing. Here's the dealmaking strategy that's netted him 3,500 units to date.\n\nHaving burned out on the startup grind, Spencer Hilligoss wanted to find a way to financial independence that would be predictable and lucrative.

The professional services giant Deloitte founded its Cloud Institute last year, providing employees the chance to pursue technical roles in-house. A thousand people went through it last year, with quadruple the cohort in 2020.\n\nVerily just presented for the first time at JPMorgan's big health conference. Here's how the CEO of Alphabet's life sciences firm laid out the unusual business to top investors.\n\nVerily is one of the most intriguing names in health. Owned by Google parent Alphabet, the firm has taken on $US1.8 billion in investments, and it's involved in projects ranging from addiction treatment to robotics.

Researchers said the spike was a result of temperature fluctuation.\n\nSAFAR categorises AQI for pollutants in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. Bandra-Kurla Complex was the most polluted location in the city with AQI at 323 (very poor), followed by Navi Mumbai 264 (poor). Worli (241), Mazagaon (230), Malad (211), Chembur (209), and Borivli (229), all recorded 'poor' air quality on Sunday, while Colaba (116) and Andheri (180) recorded 'moderate' air pollution. Bhandup had the cleanest air in the city at 93 (satisfactory). \"After cold conditions on Friday, temperatures began rising gradually on Saturday. The boundary layer of pollutants moved closer to the surface and allowed an increase in overall AQI. This boundary layer became thicker owing to calm winds on Sunday, leading to poor AQI,\" said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.\n\nA citizens' group campaigning against air pollution, Clean Air Collective, said state bodies should have issued advisories of deteriorated air quality during the Mumbai Marathon on Sunday. \"The Australian Open recently announced that they will keep air quality in mind for future tournaments. In India, there's a need for responsible sports protocols, considering the amount of sporting events being organised in winter. AQI above 150 mandates reducing outdoor sports but we have thousands running marathons in a high air pollution scenario,\" said Brikesh Singh, member, Clean Air Collective. \"It seems that the Mumbai police or the civic chief were not aware of deteriorated air quality,\" said Bhagwan Keshabat, another member.\n\nMeanwhile, the minimum temperature continued to be 2 degrees below normal at 15.8 degrees Celsius on Sunday, but much higher than previous days. On Friday, the city recorded its lowest January minimum temperature since 2013, at 11.4 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature in the suburbs increased to 13.4 degrees Celsius on Saturday. The maximum temperature was close to the normal mark. Moisture levels were high on Sunday, with 90% humidity in south Mumbai and 80% in the suburbs through the day.\n\nSAFAR predicted an AQI of 200 (moderate) for Monday, while the weather bureau predicted a minimum temperature of 15 degrees Celsius and maximum of 31 degrees Celsius.",

                "body": "You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit image gallery to purchase the image.\n\nAbout $1.5 billion in construction projects will be finished and opened this year in Christchurch, marking another milestone in the rebuild.\n\nOf the 12 anchor projects six have been completed with two more due to be finished this year.\n\nThey are the new Christchurch Hospital Acute Services Building and the new convention centre at a cost of $975 million.\n\nThey are the new Christchurch Hospital Acute Services Building and the new convention centre at a cost of $975 million.\n\nOther major projects also likely to be finished include two new motorways coming in at a cost of $485m.\n\nInside the 10-storey Christchurch Hospital Acute Services Building, you get the sense it's nearly ready.\n\nEquipment and furniture are mostly where they need to be and workers are doing minor touch-ups.\n\nWhen completed later this year the Ministry of Health will hand it over the Canterbury District Health Board and it will finally be opened to the public.\n\nThe ministry's programme director, Tony Lloyd, said the $500m building has faced a number of challenges due to complex seismic strengthening.\n\n\"The size and enormity of the building is such that, you know there's something like 3000 rooms in this building,\" Lloyd said.\n\n\"There's 6000 tonnes of steel, there's thousands and thousands of kilometres of wiring and pipe work, all of which needs to be considered in a seismic way so that the building will perform during an earthquake and after an earthquake.\"\n\nThe seismic work has resulted in two years of frustrating delays (the hospital was originally meant to open mid-2018, but now likely for mid-2020), but Lloyd said they wanted to make sure everything was done right.\n\nAny equipment over 7kg that goes on a wall has had to be engineered so that it doesn't affect the seismic performance of those walls.\n\nThe hospital has 129 base isolators, 413 beds and a rooftop helipad.\n\nIt is 'Importance Level Four' out of Five on the Building Code, meaning it can operate immediately after a one in 2500 year earthquake. Level Five structures are those such as dams or nuclear facilities.\n\nLloyd said the building has also been designed to be efficient and welcoming.\n\n\"Well, because it's a hospital, it's about making people well isn't? And then helping families that are in a distressed part of their life. So the more that we can do, as a team to bring a facility as good as this to help and facilitate that, then we should be doing everything we possibly can,\" he said.\n\nAlso opening this year is the $475m Convention Centre on the northwest corner of Cathedral Square, the new Spark building also in Cathedral Square, the restored Public Trust Building on Oxford Terrace and the $11m New Brighton Hot Pools.\n\nCentral city councillor Jake McLellan said 2020 brings a lot of promise to the CBD.\n\n\"It feels like a bit of a watershed time for the central city at the moment. For pretty much my entire adult life there hasn't been a central city. Now it feels that there is that critical mass of art and culture, of restaurants and bar hospitality and we have nice places to walk as well,\" he said.\n\nMcLellan said he is also looking forward to the restoration of the 95-year-old Public Trust Building.\n\nBut what will likely have the biggest impact on the city are the Christchurch Northern Corridor and Southern Motorway projects worth $485m.\n\nThe Transport Agency's portfolio delivery manager, Colin MacKay, said the motorways will slash travel times across the city. For example, on the southern motorway the time it takes to go from the CBD to Rolleston will be halved to about 15 minutes.\n\n\"Essentially the same can be said for the Northern Corridor. There's a lot of people moved out to the northern suburbs or North Canterbury, Waimakariri, Rangiora and Kaiapoi, so commuting is going to be a lot easier from north of the [Waimakariri] river,\" MacKay said.\n\nThis year's projects do not mean the end of the rebuild, with projects such as the $300m Metro Sports Facility due to open next year.\n\nConstruction on the new $473m multi-use arena is also hoped to begin in 2021.",

                "body": "Smith scored 131 in Australia's 9-286 on Sunday night, before a Rohit Sharma century saw India chase down the target with 15 balls to spare.\n\nAfter they failed to build upon an early base with the bat, India could cruise through their innings with little risks taken\n\nOnly Ashton Agar's 1-38 and Adam Zampa's 1-44 slowed the hosts' momentum, while Pat Cummins had one of the worst days of his ODI career with 0-64 from seven overs.\n\nMitchell Starc also went at 7.3 an over, while Josh Hazlewood was more impressive with 1-55 in his first ODI in 14 months.\n\nBut after Agar dismissed KL Rahul for 19, Sharma and Virat Kohli put on a show.\n\nSharma notched up his eighth one-day century against Australia to finish on 119 from 128 balls, while Kohli also hit 89 before being bowled by Hazlewood.\n\nAustralia were most left to rue a poor end to their own batting innings, where no-one could go with Smith.\n\nThe former captain hit 36 from 21 balls in the final 10 overs, while his teammates contributed just 22 from 39 balls in the same period.\n\nAshton Turner scored only four but chewed up 10 balls, while Agar went at less than a run a ball for his 11no.\n\n\"We were probably a few short,\" captain Aaron Finch said.\n\n\"Just as we started to build a platform we lost a wicket and then rebuild again and lose one.\n\n\"That middle order in particular haven't played a hue amount of one-day cricket. They're still learning.\"\n\nMitchell Starc was also shuffled up to No.5 to try and take on the spinners as a pinch hitter, but fell to a third-ball duck.\n\nIt all highlighted the Aussies' lack of power hitting in the area after dropping Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis after poor World Cups.\n\nAfterwards, India captain Virat Kohli admitted he was surprised Maxwell hadn't been on the tour to lift the run-rate.\n\n\"I was very surprised he wasn't here, especially the way he performed last time in the T20 series.\n\n\"He got 100 in the last game and they won the series here.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Smith also had to brush aside a mix up with Finch, as the Aussie captain was run out for 19 and yelled in Smith's direction on the way off the field.\n\nWhile there were issues at the other end, Smith never lost his composure to post his first ODI century in three years.\n\nHe played gloriously all around the ground and became the fourth-fastest Australian to 4000 ODI runs along the way before he hold out off Mohammad Shami in the 48th over.\n\nSmith combined in a 127-run stand with Marnus Labuschagne, who again looked busy for his 54 from 64, while Alex Carey also hit 35 from 36.\n\nHowever, the target never looked like being enough on a batter-friendly wicket, as India cruised home with regular opener Shikhar Dhawan nursing an injured shoulder.\n\nIt marks Australia's first loss in a bilateral series since last January.",

It was in the darbar of King Tribhuwan Bir Bikram Shah of Nepal, in 1952. I was 22,\" Jasraj says. \"After my very first rendition, King Tribhuwan awarded me 5,000 mohurs. It was more than I could count.\" But what Pandit Jasraj is perhaps most proud of is his reputation for reviving old forms such as the haveli sangeet style, once performed almost exclusively in temples. \"I also sang in films, when the compositions were based on raags. Then in the 1970s, I introduced a unique form of jugalbandi to classical music. It was called Jasarangi, a name chosen by listeners at a concert in Pune in the '70s. Jasrangi evolved from the idea of equality,\" he says. Here, a male and a female singer sang different raags, and eventually merged their individual scales into one unified sound.\n\nFor him, the path to success lies in constantly evolving. \"With technology, it's inevitable. Today I can teach students over Skype, and impart the same Guru Mukh Vidya that gurus and shishyas did in the past. I can live-stream concerts, the audio quality is much better and I can perform for thousands at a time.,\" he says.",

                "body": "The CW's Supergirl returns tonight with an all-new post-crisis episode. In the aftermath of Crisis, Supergirl faces new threats and adjusts to the new status quo. Supergirl airs tonight, January 19, 2020 at 9 p.m. EST on the CW.\n\nThe episode, titled \"The Bottle Episode\" was directed by Tawnia McKiernan and written by Derek Simon, Nicki Holcomb and Jen Troy. Meaghan Rath, the real-life sister of Brainy-5's actor, guest stars.\n\nIn an exclusive clip posted by TV Line, we see Lena waking up after the events of Crisis to Lex cooking her breakfast. All is not well with Lena, though. Due to a deal Lex made with the Monitor, Lena remembers everything, including the events of crisis. She thinks she killed Lex before the Crisis even started and is more than a little surprised to see him in her apartment.\n\nLex tells her that they now run Luthorcorp and the DEO together, prompting Lena to say \"I'm in hell.\" Fans will remember that the relationships between Lena and just about every other character on the show have been complicated. She found out that Kara is Supergirl at the end of last season, but she waited to say anything until Kara told her the secret herself.\n\nCrisis aftermath also shows that Kara is now on the same Earth as The Flash, Black Lightning, Batwoman, and the Legends. The group formed The Justice League at the end of the last Crisis episode.\n\nIt has been a while on the show since Kara has had a love interest, but that might change later this season. She's been paired with a potential love interest, William Dey (Staz Nair), the new investigative reporter. while they didn't get off on the right foot, their chemistry has been growing since his introduction.\n\nBoth characters have a dedication to finding the truth and journalism in general, sharing a passion for exposing corruption and evil-doers. Nair spoke with TV Guide about the potential of his character and Kara's being together later in the season.\n\n\"He's a nerd, he likes reading books,\" he said. \"And I think it would be a nice change for Kara to go for someone like that. There is, yes, attractive, whatever, charming - all the typical kind of points that are necessary, but they get on, on kind of their weirdness, their niches. William could maybe, if that was to happen, maybe he could fit that role.\"\n\nThere is no telling if there will be changes to Nair's character post-Crisis, however; the Arrowverse has already shown us a number of changes in other shows, from the Legends becoming famous to Diggle's daughter, Sara, existing even though she was originally erased from the timeline when Flashpoint happened.\n\nJanuary 26, 2020: \"Back From the Future Part One\" will air. The episode will see Winn Schott, Supergirl's old best friend, return from the future, where he's been with the Legion of Superheros since Mon-El and Saturn Girl's departure.\n\nWinn will be back for a total of three episodes. February 2, 2020 will air a rerun, but the show should be back to normal airing after that week for the rest of the season.\n\nTune in to the CW at 9 p.m. to see how Supergirl's life has been changed in the post-crisis world.",

Adam Schiff said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.'' Schiff was selected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as the lead impeachment manager for Trump's Senate trial.\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., contended that the National Security Agency \"in particular is withholding what are potentially relevant documents to our oversight responsibilities on Ukraine, but also withholding documents potentially relevant that the senators might want to see during the trial. That is deeply concerning.\" He also said \"there are signs that the CIA may be on the same tragic course.\"\n\nThe NSA and CIA did not immediately respond to a requests for comment.\n\nTrump's impeachment trial resumes Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats have previously criticized the State Department for withholding relevant documents to the impeachment inquiry. In the weeks since Trump was impeached, Democrats have sought to focus on new evidence about Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals and are pushing the Senate to consider new documents and testimony, such as from former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nDuring the ABC interview, Schiff was asked about a Politico report that said intelligence officials were pushing the House and Senate Intelligence committees to drop the public portion of an annual briefing on world security threats following last year's session in which Trump lashed out over the assessments on North Korea, Iran and the Islamic State.\n\nThe request was reportedly being made in a bid to avoid a repeat in which intelligence officials might publicly disagree with Trump on the security risks.\n\n\"Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!\" Trump tweeted after that Jan. 29 hearing, before abruptly reversing course and saying he and the intelligence community \"are all on the same page.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Schiff described the news reports as \"all too accurate.\"\n\n\"The intelligence community is reluctant to have an open hearing, something that we had done every year prior to the Trump administration, because they're worried about angering the president,\" he said.",

(AP) -- A North Carolina police department has released body-camera video of a traffic stop that prompted a use-of-force investigation.\n\nRaleigh police released video on Friday that showed two officers grabbing, punching and kneeing a man who was shown ignoring their orders, The News & Observer reported. Footage shot by a passenger in the car was widely shared online earlier in the week.\n\nPolice previously said the suspect, Braily Andres Batista-Concepcion, 22, was arrested Tuesday as officers stopped him in connection with three hit-and-run crashes earlier that day. One 911 caller noted that a driver hit her car, then backed up and attempted to hit her again, according to calls obtained by news outlets. Another caller reported being hit by a similar car hit twice before taking off. The suspect was also accused of hitting a pole.\n\nAn officer pulled over a car matching the description and driving erratically, a police news release said. The driver, Batista, appeared to be impaired while transporting three passengers, police noted.\n\nHe was charged with several misdemeanors, including hit and run, possession of marijuana and resisting arrest.\n\n\"They hit me so bad I forgot everything,\" he told the newspaper earlier in the week.\n\nThe president of the Raleigh chapter of the NAACP said the suspect's choices contributed to the confrontation but that all parties involved should have behaved differently, TV station WTVD reported.\n\n\"When given a direction by an officer, please follow it,\" Police Chief Cassandra Deck-Brown said at a news conference. \"Compliance and cooperation is so important during these types of situations.\"",

The dealer moved 5,158 units in the review period, surpassing the 4,632 units it sold in 2018. Toyota Kenya, which is ranked second, saw its unit sales drop to 3,538 from 3,973 over the same period.\n\nSimba Corporation, whose sales of Renault cars have been disrupted by a dispute with the owner of the French car franchise, was among the other dealers whose sales also dropped. The KMI data shows that the industry's sales opened at 835 units in January and rose strongly to a high of 1,372 units in August before receding to close at 1,124 units in December.\n\nThe performance has been attributed to reduced demand from the government.\n\n\"The national government has cut spending, especially in this fourth quarter. Dealers are also cautious about supplying to county governments because of the pending bills,\" Rita Kavashe, chairperson of KMI and Isuzu's chief executive said in a recent interview.\n\nShe added that banks are also yet to increase financing of vehicles even after the repeal of rates cap. Most companies and individuals rely on bank loans to buy new vehicles.",

They're still learning.\"\n\nMitchell Starc was also shuffled up to No.5 to try and take on the spinners as a pinch hitter, but fell to a third-ball duck.\n\nIt all highlighted the Aussies' lack of power hitting in the area after dropping Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis after poor World Cups.\n\nAfterwards, India captain Virat Kohli admitted he was surprised Maxwell hadn't been on the tour to lift the run-rate.\n\n\"I was very surprised he wasn't here, especially the way he performed last time in the T20 series.\n\n\"He got 100 in the last game and they won the series here.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Smith also had to brush aside a mix up with Finch, as the Aussie captain was run out for 19 and yelled in Smith's direction on the way off the field.\n\nWhile there were issues at the other end, Smith never lost his composure to post his first ODI century in three years.\n\nHe played gloriously all around the ground and became the fourth-fastest Australian to 4000 ODI runs along the way before he hold out off Mohammad Shami in the 48th over.\n\nSmith combined in a 127-run stand with Marnus Labuschagne, who again looked busy for his 54 from 64, while Alex Carey also hit 35 from 36.\n\nHowever, the target never looked like being enough on a batter-friendly wicket, as India cruised home with regular opener Shikhar Dhawan nursing an injured shoulder.\n\nIt marks Australia's first loss in a bilateral series since last January.",

                "body": "Kenya Roads Board will need the National Treasury approvals for the proposed roads bonds as a new debt policy comes into place next month.\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta has said the government would float an infrastructure bond of Sh150 billion, with the funds going to the completion of all ongoing road and infrastructure projects.\n\nHowever, with the new policy, the issue will have to pass strict guidelines that limit commercial loans to profitable projects and require vetting before funding can be committed.\n\n\"The law requires that they come to us for approval. They will have to be dealt with within this policy,\" said Public Debt Management Office Director-General Harun Sirima.\n\n\"If your borrowing is such that it will undermine the debt strategy then it is a public policy. We can't allow it to happen.\n\n\"And by the way, there are many parastatals which come asking for borrowing and they are told no.\n\n\"The point here is this idea of approving on an ad hoc basis is what we need to remove such that we inculcate a culture of transparency such that everybody knows. For instance, you cannot borrow externally because you are harming our debt sustainability,\" he said.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has criticised the government for accumulating projects without having a plan of how to fund or complete them.\n\nOut of 1,000 projects, 500 have stalled due to non-payment to contractors, especially the State Department of Infrastructure, which has accumulated pending bills worth Sh78 billion in June 2019.\n\nThe IMF said some projects did not follow the laid down procurement procedures and were either single-sourced or had deals struck in boardrooms. \"Several large government-to-government contractual arrangements, such as the Nairobi-Mombasa SGR project, operate outside the standard procurement process,\" IMF said.\n\nTo deal with this, the government last year approved a controversial law allowing the Kenya Roads Board to borrow up to Sh360 billion for road repairs and maintenance that will not appear in the country's debt register.\n\nIt gave the State agency, which manages road maintenance levy and transit tolls, the power to issue bonds backed by taxes on fuel imports and annual budgetary allocations for roads.\n\nThe independent debt office, however, said this is public debt and will have to be approved before it is procured.",

The UK manufacturing operation employs over 3,800 workers directly.\n\nBritain's car and aerospace industries have led criticism of UK government plans to split from European regulations after Brexit, warning it will cost \"billions\" of pounds and damage \"UK manufacturing and consumer choice\".\n\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders issued a statement after Sajid Javid, the chancellor, told the Financial Times that there would \"not be alignment\" with EU rules after Britain left the bloc, and that companies would have to \"adjust\".\n\nA senior Toyota executive last week warned that any move away from EU standards could put the future of its UK manufacturing operations in jeopardy.\n\nMatt Harrison, executive vice president of Toyota told The Irish Times: \"All of our lobbying activity and breifing towards the UK government is about protecting one set of standards. It's extremely difficult for automotive companies to start looking at multiple levels of standards. The scale of opportunity in individual markets is not sufficient to justify that level of complexity.\"\n\nToyota has two manufacturing facilities in Britain, a vehicle manufacturing plant in Burnaston, Derbyshire producing the current Corolla hatchback and estate, and an engine plant in Deeside, Wales. The UK manufacturing operation employs over 3,800 workers directly.\n\nCarmakers at present are able to sell cars across the EU and the UK under one certificate. The process, called homologation, involves expensive procedures such as engineering the vehicles to meet emissions standards. Costly crash tests are also required to meet the regulations.\n\nIf Britain abandons EU standards and sets its own rules, companies wanting to sell vehicles in the UK are likely to need to obtain a separate certificate to do so, increasing their costs of making vehicles specifically for the British market.\n\nMr Harrison, who was previously managing director and president of Toyota UK, said: \"Remember more than 90 per cent of the production in the UK is going out to other European markets. It would cause us a lot of difficulty if there was some sort of variation.\"\n\nA senior aerospace industry source described Mr Javid's position as unhelpful.\n\n\"We do need alignment, particularly around the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. We are no different from the automotive industry in that regard. We are looking for alignment on both.\"\n\nOn Friday Mr Javid told the FT that businesses \"have known since 2016 that we are leaving the EU\" and said they would be forced to adjust to new rules. - Additional reporting: The Financial Times Limited 2020",

                "body": "The coffee sector in Kenya have been in a crisis since 1990s with more than 40 percent decline in coffee production to the current range of below 50,000 tonnes. This has minted considerable poverty to many farmers to a point that many have abandoned coffee farming for its huge investment risks. Those who persisted in hope of future better returns have had to contend with poor living income to support their families.\n\nSome analysts have questioned the economic viability of coffee farming in Kenya specifically due to its small-scale nature on plots below a hectare and high costs of production due to expensive labour and farm inputs. Instructively, coffee farming is practiced in high altitude areas where mechanization is impossible due to topography. According to Kalro (Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation), the average cost of production for an Arabica coffee variety is Sh52.30\/kg. Currently, the national productivity stands at 3kg\/tree which is way below the 15kg\/bush potential. If we were to use these statistics to calculate the cost of producing coffee per hectare which on average can have 1350 bushes, this gives us Sh 211,815.",
